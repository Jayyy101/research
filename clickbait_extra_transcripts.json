This is a knife. Good luck. Let's go, Tareq. - [The Boys] Oh, oh, what do we do? - [Tareq] Oh my gosh, we gotta go. - [Jimmy] Tareq, our first\nstop's through the woods. - [Tareq] Jimmy, why are we\ndoing this again already? - Relax for one second.\nI've been tied up before. - [Chris] He's getting\nso much time ahead of us. - [Jimmy] We're coming out\nthe other side of the woods. Our getaway car is over here. - [Tareq] Whoa, that's a nice car, Jim. - [Jimmy] The car matches my bag. - [Tareq] We gotta go. We gotta go. - [Chris] How are you gonna catch him if your hands are tied? - And now we drive down this path. You guys have no idea what I\nhave in store for the boys. I rented an NFL football\nstadium, an island, a maze, and tons of other cool things. And stop! - [Tareq] Oh! Why are we stopping already? - Just watch. You see this giant telephone pole? - [Tareq] Uh huh. - Watch this. - [Tareq] Oh, oh, oh my gosh- - Let's get back in the car. (car revving) - Buckle up. - Now there's a giant telephone\npole blocking the exit. - [The Boys] Oh. - Oh, here we go. - [The Boys] Hurry. - Grab on. Push it over. - Ohh!\n- Push go. - [Karl] Guys, hurry up! - We put a GPS in my underwear so the FBI agent and the boys\nwill always know where I'm at. - [Nolan] Jimmy turned. - [Chris] Oh, wait, he turned? - [Nolan] He turned left. - If you zoom in- - It's a maze! - It's a maze! It gives us the layout of the maze. - We're now at the Hedge Maze and I got the hundred thousand dollars. Look at how huge this maze is. We gotta be careful because\nit'd be easy to get lost and for them to catch us in here. - [Jimmy] Uh, I think it's this way. - [Tareq] Okay...Uh, how do you know? - I've done this maze like 10 times, but the boys have never been here. - We're just gonna push him and push him, get him out of the area, and then as he's tiring,\nwe'll handle this. - I'm gonna leave them some money here so they know they're going the right way. Or a random person's\njust gonna find a grand. (Jimmy chuckles) - [The Boys] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - [Nolan] It says open 11 to five. - [Kurt] See if we can\nactually get right through it. - [Chris] Ooh. - [Kurt] Here we go. - [Jimmy] It was right,\nright, left, right, left, right, right, left. Perfect. Okay. If you're in the cave,\nyou're in the right spot, which means if we go here, now we are officially in the watch tower. We can see the entire maze. - I'm gonna do a perimeter check. Make sure he is not outside. We gotta find the getaway car. - Hey Karl, come on. - There's that nerd.\n- Hey, there he is! - Ooh!\n- Okay! - [Jimmy] I bet you can't get me. - Ooh. The only exit is right here. - [Chris] Why is there money over here? - That was just to let you know you were going the right way. - [Chris] Jimmy, we're almost there. Just wait. - Oh, they are getting close. Shoot, okay. We gotta go, we gotta go. They're getting closer. I don't know how long I\nplanned on staying there. (Tareq laughs) - [Chris] He's older than us, but he's got so much more energy. Isn't this where Jimmy was? - [Kurt] Yes, it was. - I know you're looking at this, Jimmy. I'm taking your camera now. - The only exit outside\nof this entire maze is all the way up there, which is why yesterday\nwe put in a secret door. - [Tareq] Oh wow. Jimmy, this is crazy. Wait, Jimmy, is that our getaway car? - Notice how this says,\n\"Authorized Maze Personnel Only\". Now it says, \"Jimmy's Getaway Car\". - [Kurt] Hey guys, let's\ngo back to the car. The tracker's showing him up on the hill. - [Karl] All right. To the car! - [The Boys] Let's go!\n- [Kurt] Let's go- - [Karl] Go, go, go, go, go.\n- [Nolan] Get in. - I wonder if they've noticed\nwe're not in the maze anymore. - [Nolan] He's getting on the highway. - [Chris] Which way? Left or right? - Right.\n- Right. - We can make all the\nmistakes in the world- - Doesn't matter- - He's just gotta make one- - He gotta make one. - Yeah. - Yo, there were parts where\nwe were so close to them in the maze. That was terrifying. If they would've caught us there, this video would've been\nonly like two minutes. I made a mistake. Tareq's supposed to be\ndriving. Let's switch. - [Tareq] Let's switch. - Karl is the, is that money real? - Oh, it's real real. - Oh good. (boys laughing) - And the reason Tareq is driving, is because I need to put on a disguise. (soft, exciting music) I look so old. Now we put the hat on, throw\non a pair of glasses, and boom. I'm Boomer Jim. And we're heading to Walmart where I'm gonna try to\nblend in with normal people. - Do you think he went to the mall to shop and we all go shopping? - We're pulling up to Walmart\nand I'm gonna go inside with the hundred thousand\ndollars and the tracker. There's a pickax back here. And while they're inside searching for me, you need to pop all the tires\non their car to strand them. - Jimmy, I've never\npopped a tire in my life. - Let's do this. - [Chris] Wait. It says\nwe're on top of him- - [The Boys] Hey! - [Kurt] Yeah. It says\nwe're right on top of him- - Take a, take a right down here- - [Karl] He's right here. - Don't let me down\nwith popping the tires. - [Tareq] I won't. God speed. - Park away from cars and\nlet's assess the situation. - And now I'm inside Walmart. And before I blend in, I\nneed to disguise this bag. Now I'm gonna take the hundred\nthousand dollar backpack and put it in this bag. Now they'll never catch me. - You and I will go inside. You two stay, stay together. And let's see if we can search 'em out. Inside! Hold his hand, there ya go. - We're staying together. (phone ringing) - Are they here yet? - They're walking out right\nnow. They're going inside. - All right. They're going inside? - Yes, yes, yes.\n(phone call ends) - The boys are about to\ncome inside. We gotta go. - [Tareq] They have no idea I'm gonna smash all their tires. Look at 'em running. - [Chris] Looking for a six foot four guy, with a weird beard. - I can literally see the boys walking down the gaming aisle. - I know that Jimmy told\nme to pop all the tires, but I'm just gonna do one. Cuz I think I'm running low on time. FBI? More like, FB flat tire! (air hissing) (Tareq running) Oh, I gotta get the camera. - He's not walking around\nanywhere. He's gotta be hiding. (phone ringing) - [Jimmy] Did you do the deed? - The deed is done. - They're so close to me.\nI'm getting outta here. - [Tareq] Hurry up, grandpa. - I can't believe that worked. They were literally one\naisle beside me at one point. - What's the tracker say? - [Kurt] The tracker's\nmoving. The vehicle's moved. - Wait, it's moving?\n- In the parking lot? - He's outta the...he's outta Walmart? - It feels amazing to have that mask off. We've knocked over a telephone pole, had a goose chase through a maze, and then hid in a Walmart as an old man. And the video's just getting started. I have so much more cool stuff planned. Like I'm literally heading to the airport to board a private jet right now. - Wait a second!\n- What's that? Who popped our tires?\nThere's a pickax in our tire. - Well, if we don't have a\ncar, we're gonna change a flat. - [Nolan] Do you know\nhow to change a tire? - Of course I know how to change a tire. - [Chris] Remember you wanna go two or- (car falling) Yeah. That's why I don't like those jacks. - [Kurt] Yep. - Karl? - [Karl] Yeah? - Do you know where I\nwas hiding at Walmart? - No! - Basically I put on an old man suit, changed my clothes, and used a cane. Did you see a really old guy limping? - I don't pay attention to old people. - Well if you did see one\nin Walmart, it was me. Good luck, nerd! (phone call ends) - Brah! (Chris groaning) - [Nolan] Chris, you working hard? - [Chris] You're hardly working. - We're getting close to the airport. I'm gonna call the private jet\nand make sure they're ready. - It looks like he's on a taxiing runway. - He's gonna get in a plane and fly away. - This is why he slashed the tires. - And there's our private jet. Let's go. I'm getting on a private\njet with the dumbest outfit and a Cars backpack. What am I doing with my life? Come on. You're taking forever. I'm gonna try to time it where\nthe private jet takes off when they get here so they\ncan see me flying away. - What's up, Jimmy? - Hey buddy. How far away are you? - We're at the Walmart\nman. Still fixing the tire. - Okay. Well- - Hey Jimmy, if you had to\npick a terminal to go into, would it be the passenger terminal?- - Oh, so that means you're here. Pilot, you can take off. - [Chris] Run, run, run.\nGo, go, go, go, go, go, go. (upbeat music) - [Kurt] Last door. - Later, nerds. - That's him. That's him on that jet right there. - [Karl] Dude! - I have no idea how they're\ngonna track where we're going. - We're gonna follow the airplane. Let's check inside where it's going. - Can we just do that? - Yes. Why not? - Oh. I guess he is FBI. - How you doing? FBI. Where did the airplane that\njust left, where is it going? - Uh. Washington, D.C.. (boys gasp) - [The Boys] What!\n- Wonderful. - Is there another flight\nto Washington, D.C.? - [Kurt] Anytime soon. - I don't see anything today. No. - Do we have to drive all\nthe way to Washington, D.C.? That's like-\n- Hey, at least we got- - Three hours! - We gotta, we gotta new\ntire for it. So we're good. - New tire. Let's go. - Private jet with stacks of money? For the first time ever, I\nactually feel like a YouTuber. And now we're in Washington, D.C.. We got about a three hour lead. And conveniently our driver is Nick. You might remember him from this video. He's so much nicer when\nhe's not chasing me. - Ha ha! You ready to get outta here? - Let's go. - Let's go. - Guys! He just landed in D.C.. - [Chris] What? - [Karl] Actually? - [Nolan] Yeah. - That's over two hours away now still. - Are we finally in Washington, D.C.? - Holy cow-\n- What does it say- - Wait, Washington the state? Cuz that would suck. - And now we're at our\nnext location; the U-Store. So like we talked about on the phone, distract the boys, okay? - Okay. - He's right beside Costa Rica trading. Whatever that is, it's right beside it. - I just bought this storage locker and I'm gonna put this sign\nright here with this message: \"Time is running out. I was in the box.\" If that doesn't make any sense,\njust gimme a few seconds. - Maybe we can approach from the back. - Hey, I tried that\nwith your mom one time. (boys laughing) - Me and you are gonna\nhide in these boxes. We're literally about\nto get shipped alive. - Jimmy, what is this? What do you have me doing bro? - Oh, that was probably\nthe worst drive ever. - Ahhh! - Karl. You stay here\nand watch the vehicle. Make sure no one pops our tire again. - I'll sit right here. - [The Boys] You're standing. - I'm wondering if you've\nseen this individual. - Oh yeah, I saw him. - Still around here? - Yeah. I think he's downstairs. Let me take you there. - Downstairs!\n- Downstairs? - Downstairs? - Should we just be\nfollowing random people to their basement? Is this okay? I just don't understand why\nall this is necessary, Jimmy. - Let me get something to cut it. Can you wait for me here, sir? - Yeah. - That truck you see\nright here is my getaway. I'm being transported right now. Karl was right above us. - Holy crap. (blade cutting) - [The Boys] This is so extra! Hey, here we go. - [Chris] \"Time is\nrunning out. Karl sucks. I was in the box.\" - Hey, hey. Check the tracker right now. - [Chris] We're gonna have to go upstairs to get service, to check. - Are we free to get out? - [Tareq] Um. Hold on. Not yet. - I got Jimmy right here. He's gone. He's long gone- - Here's the thing. There was a box truck when we got here. He's gone in the box truck! - [Karl] Guys! Where have you been? - Come on. We just gotta go. - I can't believe that worked. Up next, we're going to a private island. - Jimmy looks like he's crossed a bridge and now going to a boathouse. - Oh my goodness. So we got a plane, a boat, a box truck. What else is he gonna do? - Thanks for the trip. Have a good day. Even though that was really cool. The box truck moves incredibly slow, so they could be here any second. What's up, man? You ready to take us to the island? Let's do this. - Jimmy's calling. What's up, Jimmy? - [Jimmy] Okay. What up, Chris? Hey, how's it going? You getting in a boat? - No, actually I'm not. - That's a nice pier you're at. - Wait. Where are you? - Maybe we might be about to\ntackle you in about 10 seconds- - Maybe I'm under-\n- I hung up. Look now we're turning the tables. He thinks we're right\nby him and we're not! - Wait. I was calling him\nto brag about the boxes, but now I'm confused. - [Karl] There are so many\nboats here. What is going on? - All right. There he is go, go, go, go. - [Tareq] That's Karl. That's Karl. - You nerd! - [Tareq] They're coming!\n- [Jimmy] Go, go, go. - [Tareq] They're coming in strong. - I got you some swan boats. - It's always boats with you. - Hey, get to pedaling\non your little swan. - We'll go after him- - Go.\n- Go! - We'll get in the next one. - I'm gonna be honest. I never tested those swans. For all I know, they could be really fast. - Wow. This is slow. This is unreasonably slow. - Did you ever chase\nanyone on a swan before? - This will be a first. `- I'm gonna act like the boat broke. Hey, Karl! - Yes? - My boat isn't working. So I'd hurry up. - His boat's broken. Here's our chance. Hurry! (boys grunting) - This is the most\nanti-climatic thing ever. - [Tareq] Yeah. - You got four hours left\nuntil I keep the hundred grand. See you later. - You'll pay! - And now we're at the island. Hurry up, nerds! - Come on over, let's talk. The sun's not even down yet, my friend. - They just docked. - [Tareq] Go, go, go, go. They're close! - [Chris] Hey, come on, guys. - [Kurt] You're going right in. You're fine. - What the heck are we doing? - I think we're lost.\nWe went the wrong way. Oh where do we go? Please help us. Help us. Help us. We asked some people\non the island for help. Cause to be honest, I'm lost. - [Tareq] Me too. - Jimmy, I will end you! We're stuck. We're lost. (indistinct) Now we found a path. This has\nto be where Jimmy's going. - I only have three more hours here. We need to get going here. He's on the other side of the island. - We make it outta here\nwithout getting found, then we're finally going\nto the NFL stadium. Are you subscribed? - Uh yeah. - [Tareq] Jimmy we don't have time. - We always have time for this. - [Tareq] That's fair. - I don't care to fact check\nyou. Here's some money. - Uh what? - Thanks for subscribing. Now\nI gotta run to regain my time. - [Tareq] Yes! - Guys? What! Kurt. There's nothing. - We made it off the island\nto our getaway vehicle. And now it's time for my\nfavorite part of the video. We're heading to an NFL\nstadium that I rented. - We should have never got on this island. - Let's see where he is now. - [The Boys] Oh, he's still driving? - He's going towards Capitol Hill. - I can't believe we rented\nan entire NFL stadium. Look at how huge this place is! This is gonna be so much fun. - [Karl] Let's get to our car. Come on. We have like two hours left. - I hate to break the bad news to you, but it ain't a spa. - What is it? - A football stadium. - He's at a football stadium? - That sounds like running... - I have a pre-recorded\nvideo of me on loop telling them they'll never find me. \"You'll never find me in this stadium. Losers.\" Isn't that so funny? And not only do I have\nthat video playing on loop, but I've filled the\nstadium with mannequins so they'll think it's me. They literally only have\ntwo and a half hours left to get this money. - Let's go, go, go, go, go. - Did he just rent an entire stadium? Unbelievable. Let's see where he is. So we have, he looks\nlike he's in the center. - Wait, Jimmy's on the TV! - [Chris] Aw. - [Kurt] Oh no. - [Chris] Come on. - All right, I think\nthat's a little too much. - Oh, he tortured me for a whole day here. - Let's go get him. - Let's go get him.\n- Can we go catch him? - Let's go get him. - [Jimmy] \"You'll never\nfind me in this stadium- - Holy cow. - \"You'll never find me-\n- [Kurt] Oh my Lord. - [Nolan] Look at all the mannequins! - As you can see, the boys\njust walked into the stadium. They're probably so confused. Can you cut the audio for me please? \"You'll never find me in this stadium.\" Wait for it... Boom. Now the audio's off. It's my time. - How did this man-\n- [Jimmy] Hello, boys. - Hello? - Hello? - As you can see, there\nis over 70,000 seats and unlimited rooms in this stadium. I need you guys to expect the unexpected. Cuz, I could literally be anywhere. And don't forget; you literally\nonly have two hours left to win this hundred thousand dollars. Good luck! - This place is huge! - What a jerk- - Oh also, Karl's a nerd. - [Karl] Stop man! What the heck! (Jimmy laughing) - Yo, this is so much fun. - Hey, hey! I saw movement in that window- - [Chris] He has to be in a box\nwhere he can reach this mic- - I swear I just saw movement. - Nolan, what are you pointing at? - I saw you! I saw movement! - Wait, where is he pointing? Turn to your left a little bit. - I see him! Run! - [Chris] I told you he was in a box. - And now they're coming\nstraight towards us. - [Tareq] Why'd you do this? - We should probably move. - [Tareq] We should go. (Tareq and Jimmy laughing) - [Chris] He's on the run! - And now we're heading out the back way. And the cool part is, they\ndon't know what the back way is. Good luck, nerds. I believe in you. - Hey guys, over here! - He just called the boys! Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - Second level. He is moving around. - [Nolan] Kurt! - He's going that way. - [Nolan] How do we get up there? - This way! Escalators. - [Jimmy] Let's go up. - [Tareq] Let's just go up? - [Nolan] Oh no! They're not working! (intense music) That's Jimmy! - [Jimmy] It's Nolan! - Hurry, it's Jimmy! - Tareq! Sacrifice yourself! - [Tareq] Sacrifice myself? - Yeah. - [Tareq] He went that way. - [Nolan] No, he didn't, there's a door! Get out of the way, Tareq! Where'd he go? Where'd he go? - Here's my strategy. I'm gonna go fake pose like a mannequin and pray they don't find me\nfor the next hour and a half. Okay? They've seen what I'm wearing. So I'm gonna steal this\nmannequins clothes. Do I look like a mannequin? - Jimmy, come on out and play. - I know he's one of the\nmannequins over there. Let's pretend like we don't know that. These stupid mannequins, man. Where is this nerd? - [Chris] If I was Jimmy,\nwhere would I hide? - [Nolan] Kurt? Kurt. - [Tareq] Jimmy, go, go, go, go. - [The Boys] Yes! Let's go! - Honestly, I've been\nrunning for like 14 hours. When he was right there, I was like, I don't feel like getting tackled. He can just have the money. What are you gonna spend\nthe hundred grand on? - I'm gonna spend it on my wife. - Really? - I'm gonna make sure that\nmy family is enjoys it. - Aw- - that's the important thing- - That's really sweet. - One of the best\nexperiences I've ever had. - In our last video, I mentioned\nthat every single person that buys this executive\nproducer shirt or hoodie will get their name at\nthe end of this video, which is why you see names on\nthe left side of your screen. Because that is every single person that purchased this shirt or hoodie. And I didn't tell you\nguys I would do this, but on top of that, we also wrote every\nsingle one of your names on the wall of my studio. Literally every day,\nwhen I come in to film, I'm gonna see your name on this wall. Like Peter Wild, when I film,\nI'm gonna be reminded of you. And same with Knox and\nKnox Tucker and Koda and Koda G and all these Michaels. And on top of that,\nChandler, bring it on in. I also got all your\nnames put on this Tesla. That's right. Not only are all\nyour names on my studio wall, but your names are also on this Tesla. And this is the fun part. Chandler, I want you to pick\na random name on this Tesla and we're gonna give it to\nthem in like 30 seconds. All right, let's do it. Matt Liggett. - [Jimmy] What about him? - [Chandler] He didn't win. - [Jimmy] Oh, he didn't win? Well, tell me when you have the winner. - Hey Jimmy, you have\nPeyton Chicken Nugget as one of your fans. - Can you investigate that?\nSee if that's their real name. - I'm thinking probably not. - Derpyfish, 89. I told you to use your real name, but I didn't actually fact check it. You go in the S category. There's a bunch of Sponge Bobs. And I know your names aren't SpongeBob. - Jimmy! - Yeah? - Tell me when to stop. - Uh, wait for it, now stop. - Oh. Which finger? - I'm a pinky kinda guy. - Alexander Hedge, this Tesla... - [The Boys] Yeah! All right- - I don't know if that made any sense. Congratulations, Alexander.\nYou just won a brand new Tesla. Sorry that it's covered in names. If you want, you can remove 'em. Thank you so much.

daddy who doesn't love a good story especially ones which involve unbelievable mythological creatures that you wouldn't remotely think are real but as history has proven there is a basis for which these creatures were brought up today we're going to be looking at ten mythical creatures that actually existed number one itself will make you question whether middle-earth was real or not so stay tuned for that one with all that said and done let's begin shall we number ten the direwolf it's a freak it's a direwolf direwolves became lively popular when Game of Thrones hit the mainstream these large wolves are a constant companion of the starts in the show and are shown to be large intelligent and protective they are not however just merely a figment of George RR Martin's imagination they are in fact based on real animals dire wolves live during the Pleistocene between 250,000 to roughly 10,000 years ago unfortunately real dire wolves were not really the size of ponies they were larger than modern wolves though and could weigh as much as 200 pounds almost twice with a very large modern wolf might weigh their skulls are much larger compared to today's modern wolves ironically though their brains are much smaller however if they had bigger brains we probably wouldn't have had amazing fossils of them thousands of dire wolf fossils have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits scientists believe that they were trapped there when they started feeding on the carcasses of other animals trapped in the tar number nine the unicorn perhaps the earliest account of unicorns is by well known Greek historian Satish yes we described a large animal with a horn on its forehead in India it's quite possible that he saw a rhino from a distance and thought it was a horse with a horn on its head but fossils unearthed in Siberia may have proven the existence of this mythical creature called the Siberian unicorn it was 1.8 metres tall over four metres long and weighed more than four tons it was covered in a shaggy coat and earned his nickname from the huge horn that grew out of its forehead yes it doesn't exactly resemble the classic unicorn of lore but so far this is the closer that we can get to a real one they were believed to have died out three hundred and fifty thousand years ago but the discovery of a fossil in Kazakhstan changed all that carbon dating tests revealed the fossil to be only 29 thousand years old this means that the animal roamed the earth 300 of 21,000 years longer than previously thought number 8 the Komodo dragon [Music] believe it or not the Komodo dragon was considered a mythical creature all the way up to 1910 when it was first discovered prior to that rumors were spreading the eight foot long hundred pound prehistoric lizards were living on a remote Indonesian island wanting to prove or disprove the existence of these creatures himself dutch colonial officer lieutenant stein van hands broke put together an expedition to komodo island he was able to catch and kill a six-foot specimen and he sent the carcass as proved to the zoological museum and botanical garden at Bogor java seemingly not satisfied with the discovery american explorer w douglas Burdon decided to put together an expedition himself making up his mind to catch live specimens in the end the expedition was able to pile several dead and to live Komodo dragons on to their steamer and then returned to New York City giving scientists plenty to study and visitors of the Bronx Zoo plenty to see number seven the Bunyip the Bunyip is a little like australia's Loch Ness monster and that it lives in the water and has never been photographed despite the fact that hundreds of people have seen it however the legend might have had actual rational origins the bunyip is an Aboriginal legend according to Australian history the name means a devil or spirit and the creature is said to look like a cross between a crocodile and a horse the granted though accounts do differ bunyips stock and kill human beings and supposedly make an eerie sound like a hollow boom which certainly seems terrifying if you've never been around any shotguns or farm equipment most scientists believe that the Bunyip was derived from an extinct rhino sized marsupial called the dipper Adhan remains of this animal were first found in the region of 1839 it's unlikely that there are any surviving populations of Dipper Don in Australia but they only dine about 20,000 to 40,000 years ago this was long after the arrival of the Aboriginal people this suggests the legends might have come from real-life encounters between humans and these creatures number six the gorilla it's hard to imagine a world without gorillas at least based on today's standards back then tales of large hairy savage man beasts with bad tempers living in the wilds of some faraway place seems too good to be true their legend persevered until 1847 when physician and naturalist Thomas savage managed to obtain gorilla bones including a skull in Liberia prior to the first discovery of the bones the first recorded sighting of a gorilla was made by the Explorer hanno in the 5th century BC another Explorer named Andrew Patel also told tales of human-like monsters visiting his campfire every morning after the humans had left for the day but he also noted that these monsters weren't intelligent enough to put more wood on the campfire so his credibility quickly went up in flames live gorillas went left unseen and untouched for a decade after savages discovery until Explorer Paul du challu hunted like gorillas and sent specimens back to the many societies who were funding his expeditions the subspecies mountain gorillas unbelievably remained a mythological creature for more than half a century more only being discovered in 1902 by German Captain Robert von borange number 5 the basilisk sallie paid the basilisk is a mythical creature born from a toader serpent's egg incubated under a cockerel the terrible offspring that hatches from this egg is a half bird half snake and all evil it is one of the deadliest creatures to Menace the mythological world and it's extremely hostile towards humans you might be familiar with this monster from the Harry Potter book and movie the Chamber of Secrets but the monster shown there is somewhat incomplete and only appears as a giant serpent the basilisk is sometimes described as a giant snake without the cockerels head or wings still its movement is unlike other snakes rather than slithering with its stomach on the ground it curls forward with the front half of its body towering above the earth the monster's most famous weapon has its dreaded gaze the potency of its gaze is discussed in all the myths that relate to them across several different cultures sometimes they are also known to breathe out fire does the description vaguely remind you of something many experts believe that the basilisk is none other than a cobra from its size of the way it stands erect when preparing to strike even the Cobras hood could be mistaken for wings and the fire-breathing part well we all know that certain species of covers have to spit out venom and this venom does cause a burning sensation so there we go the basilisk may be a misunderstood Cobra or maybe it's another undiscovered creature who knows number four the duck-billed platypus can you imagine the rest of the world thinking that you're a hoax but you know for a fact that you're a hundred percent real if you don't consider yourself lucky the duck-billed platypus however had to spend most of its existence mythological hearsay or worse a complete fabrication first discovered in the 18th century was considered by many to be a ridiculous hoax and not without reason this was an age when naturalist were creating all sorts of strange creatures with the help of taxidermy and creative imagination it was first described by English zoologist George Shaw who wrote that it resembled and I quote the beak of a duck engrafted on the head of a quadruped head all the fakery is signed the platypus is remarkable for many reasons not just its peculiar appearance naturalist could not determine whether the creature was a mammal did it lay eggs or give birth to live babies it took another 100 years for scientists to discover the answer to that as it turned out the platypus is one of the very few mammal species to lay eggs and is also poisonous fun number three the Cyclops [Music] in Greek mythology the Cyclops were giant creatures that were unmistakable in their appearance sporting a single eye in the center of each of their heads they were also known for their barbarity afraid of neither men nor gods the most famous Cyclops was Polyphemus which attacked Odysseus in a cave and ate half of his men Odysseus blinded the Cyclops eye running a wooden stake through his single eye van Odysseus and his men escaped by tying themselves to the undersides of sheep this sounds very implausible though pertaining to sheep strong enough to carry the weight of a full-grown man but the existence of Cyclops there might be some truth to that actually for many years there appeared to be solid proof that these one-eyed monsters really existed quite a few huge skulls were found which appeared to have a single eye socket in the middle of their forehead it turns out that the skulls belong to dwarf elephants the eye socket was the central nasal cavity and the opening for the elephant's trunk many dwarf elephants have been found in Cyprus especially in case where the Cyclops were supposed to have lived therefore it's perhaps natural that an elephant skull would have been taken as evidence of a race of giant man-eating creatures with one eye and terrible table manners now it's time for the day's best Pig today we're gonna be taking a look at the creature who is the poster child for mythical creatures that turned out to be real find out what comes up next with number two the Kraken release originating in Nordic folklore the Kraken was said to be a powerful sea monster strong enough to drag an entire ship to the depths by wrapping into gigantic tentacles around the vessel or by swimming in circles around it to create a whirlpool that would drag the ship down it was first written about in an 1180 and there were many accounts of a gigantic tentacled sea monster dragging their ships to their doom the Kraken was said to be able to devour an entire ship's crew in a single mouthful the myths of the Kraken is likely to have arisen after sightings of a species of the giant squid also known by its scientific name the ARCIC youthis ducks which can grow to around 59 feet long or possibly the colossal squid known by its scientific name is meso kina Thetis Hamel Tony which is significantly larger than the giant squid it can grow to unknown lengths very few colossal squids have ever been found intact as they live in the deep waters of the Antarctic for this reason it is proved very difficult to find evidence of how squid attack their prey some recent research does show that they encircle prey with their tentacles before pulling it to them and eating it so you never know I saved the best for last but first I have a quick challenge that takes only 5 seconds 53 if you can either right then subscribe within the next 5 seconds you'll get 10 years of amazing luck just try it it really worked number one hobbits if you are even barely into pop culture you'd know what a hobbit is they're basically miniature humans who have furry feet and don't wear shoes and according to stories have a propensity to save the world from evil pieces of jewelry and also literally eat you out of house and home what you might not know is the fact that actual hobbits did exist but not quite the ones you've gotten used to in 2003 archaeologists on the remains of a 3-foot tall adult female in a cave on an Indonesian island at first there was speculation that the skeleton was a person with micro and sinfully ax a comparison of the skull with modern micro if Alex though seemed to suggest it came from a typical individual there were also other indication that these were the bones of an unknown species such as extremely primitive feet those scientists failed to determine if they were particularly hairy feet which is a disappointment which mythical creature were you 100% sure wasn't real what is now in the comments section down below you want to watch more videos about amazing creatures real or otherwise click on any of the videos you see on your screen as always thank you

There are many big people\nout in the world. Whoever is taller than 7 feet is considered to be a giant. It isn t\nvery good to be tall. Large size can be a real problem for a person. It can affect your\nhealth and really decrease your life quality. Today we will show you some people that look\nvery different from regular folk. We re talking about real life giants.\n. This is Robert Bobroczky from Romania. His enormous height is a combination of genetics\nand a type of gigantism. His father was 7 ft 2 in tall and his mom 6 ft 2 in. WhenRobertwasonly14hemovedtoItaly\nwhere he became a part of a basketball team. Those people took care of his diet. Back then\nRobert used to weight 182pounds and it felt like he could brake just by making any kind\nof clumsy movement. And it still feels this way now. His movements look kind of unnatural.\nRobert used to eat 7 times a day, gaining weight by all possible means. Then video of\nhim playing appeared online. He got asked to play in US. Right now he lives in Texas\nand dreams to become a professional basketball player. He is 7 ft 8 in high and weights 225\nponds. CoachessaythatBobroczky knows how to throw a ball and he is a good player overall\nand most importantly, he s a hardworking guy. Anyways, every time he gains speed on the\nway to the hoop, it looks kind of strange. This is the problem that trainers are trying\nto fix right now. They came up with a schedule for him, which includes not only his training\nsessions but also different kinds of exercises for his body muscles. They try to do it all\ngradually so that they don t damage his body. Let s wish this guy luck and hope that he\nll achieve all the things he wishes to achieve. . Gogea Mitu\nYou re looking at the tallest boxer in history. Even famous Nikolay Valuev looks like a little\nboy standing next to him. Unfortunately nobody knows the real name of the giant. But there\nare two versions however.Gogu Stefanescu and Dumitru Guaga. This guy was also known as\nRomanian Goliath. Still, most people call him GogeaMitu. He was born on September 1909\nin Romania. When he was three years old, Mitu was taller than nine year old boys. And by\nthe age of ten he was taller than almost any grown up man.\nAt the age of 20 he started boxing. But it was very hard to find a proper opponent for\nhim. Everyone was too scared to fight him. His first fight happened at the Venus stadium\nin Bucharest. He fought against professional Italian boxer SaverioGrizzo. That time he\nknocked out his opponent in the first round. His second fight was against the Romanian\nchampion DumitruPavelescu. That time he also won with a knockout in the first round. According\nto various sources his height was 7 ft 9 in to 8 ft 2 in.\n.Igor Vovkovinskiy Next on our list is IgorVovkovinskiy from\nUkraine. He lives in US now where he already had 16 surgeries. Those made him stop growing\nand now he is 7 ft. 9 in. He grows up so fast because hispituitary gland produce too much\ngrowth hormone. Ever since he was little, it was evident that he looks nothing like\nother kids. In the 90s when Igor was only six years old, he was already about 6 feet\ntall. His family had to re-plan the house because\nof his height. Their house was much bigger than most houses. All because of the boys\nheight. Everything is big shower, kitchen, dressing room everything. And even though\nlife is hard for both Igor and his mom, they still find time and money to help those in\nneed. . Yao Defen from China was considered to be\nthe tallest woman in the world. When she was born she was much larger than her peers. She\nwas born in 1972 in Anhui. Although by the age of 11 she was already over 5 feet high.\nAll of her family members are not very tall. The reason for the way she is is the pituitary\ntumor. She stopped growing after she had a surgery. She is now 7 ft 7 in tall and weights\n390 pounds. She makes her living working in a circus.\nAnd her master didn t let her see a doctor when she had severe pains. One time during\na performance she received a few injuries but she was forced to work nevertheless and\nsometimes they even would not let her eat. Fortunately, Yao was able to escape that horrible\nslavery. She died in 2012 at a hospital after damaging her head.\n. When Ukrainian Leonid Stadnik was a teenager he had a brain surgery. After that surgery\nhe started growing really fast. Soon pituitary tumor formed in his brain, that s what made\nhim so big. Leoniddidn t feel too well. He couldn teve walk properly. For a long time\nhe refused to get in the book of records. But then he totally signed his name in the\nbook in 2007. He beat the previous record holder BaoXishun. His height was 8 ft 5 in\nand he weighted 440 pounds. In august 2008BaoXishun signed right back\nafter Stadnik refused to get measured by the officials. He said he didn t want any fame\nand he didn t want people to talk about him. For the past 10 years he s been gaining about\nan inch every month. And I guess we can conclude that by the end of his life he was really\ntall. Leonid died on august 24 in 2014. Cause of death - hormone-producing tumor hemorrhage.\n.Sultan Kosen. Turkish Sultan Kosenhas been considered the\ntallest man in the world for a long time and now it seems like he actually stopped growing.\nHe is 8ft 2 inches high. He starter growing rapidly at 10 years of age. His body was producing\nway too much growth hormone. Over the course of two decades he grew by 8 feet. He was under\nthreat of dying because his brain was taking up too much pressure.\nIn 2008Kosen had his first surgery. That s when they removed his tumor. But that didn\nt stop his growth. Only in 2010 in Virginia university they tried a new method on him,\nwhich showed some good results. Seems like Sultan officially stopped growingnow. Butlifeisn\nteasyforhim. He sveryuncomfortableinsidebuildings. Andhecanbarley getinsideacar. And he simply\ncan t find any proper clothes in regular clothing stores. There are no 5 feet long trousers\nin regular shops. But there are some obvious positives in Kosen\ns life. He enjoys listening to music and he likes watching good movies. He plays video\ngames and he chats to his Instagram followers. He posts pictures of himself sharing some\nrelevant news about his life. Sultan says he enjoys observing people from the height\nof his height and that changing laps is never a problem for him.\n.Robert Pershing Wadlow And the tallest human in all the history is\nof course Robert Wadlow. On February 22 in 1918Addie May Wadlow gave birth to a healthy\nchild and called him Robert. Robert weighted only 8 pounds. And he was a pretty ordinary\nchild but the thing about him was that he grew a lot faster than other kids. At his\nfirst birthday his weight was 44 pounds and he was 3 ft 4 inches tall. At the age of 8\nhe was already taller than his 6 feet tall dad. At thirteen he became the tallest boy\nscout and by the time he finished high school he was 8 ft. 4 in tall.\nHe was diagnosed with pituitary hyperplasia, which is something that s characterized by\nabnormally high levels of growth hormone. His gigantic proportions was a huge problem.\nHis energy demand was something like 8000 calories, which is 3 times more than a regular\nman needs on average. He experienced problems with blood circulation and he walked with\na cane most of the time. Americans always loved him and they were always proud of him.\nWadlow died in his sleep at the age of 22. Last time Robert s height was measured it\nwas 8 ft 11 in and weighted 439 pounds. Over 40 000 people came to say their goodbyes to\nthe tallest man on the planet. All the shops in town were closed on that day. His coffin\nweighted about 1000 pounds. It took 12 people to carry it. There is a real size statue of\nRobertPershingWadlow in his native town of Alton in Illinois. Also there are a few wax\nfigures of this remarkably tall men in Ripley's museums.\n.Emmanuel Yarbrough The next giant man on the list is the heaviest\nathlete in history. It sEmmanuel Yarbrough. He s a sumo wrestler and mma fighter. His\nsize isn t exactly typical for an mma fighter. He used to fight his opponents when he weighted\n650 pounds, being 6 feet 7 in tall. But he would often loose as his opponents would normally\nmake him all weary and then beat the hell out of him. Perhaps the most fun fight was\nwhen he went up against DaijuTakase who weighted 167 pounds. Yarbroughdidn t even need to do\nanything. He just had to lay down on his opponent. But the Japanese was very nimble and Yarbrough\ncould hardly lay his hands on him. .Choi Hong-man\nLast man on our list is Hong Man Choi. Another MMA fighter. He s from south Korea, he is\n7 ft 2 in high and weights 352 pounds. He once fought against FedorEmelianenko. Back\nthenFedor won the fight but at some point throughout the fight it seemed like Fedor\nwas done for good when the giant was lying on top of him.\nSo there you go, giants are among us you guys.

today we're going to be looking at 10 giants that exist in real life these people are either really huge in terms of their height or in terms of their muscles but seriously though some of these people legitimately look photoshopped but i can guarantee that these people are a hundred percent real so please drop a like if you enjoy let's aim for four thousand likes on this video because it really does help me out so coming in at number ten we have sajad garibbi so this guy is from iran and he got really famous on instagram and he has over 200 000 followers he's nicknamed the iranian giant because of his insane build he's only 24 and he weighs 24 stone and 90 percent of that is pure muscle i don't even know if that's good for you but seriously this guy is thick af i'm joking guys but this guy is weirdly big and to show you how big he actually is he usually poses with small objects to show how huge he is in comparison to them it's called overcompensating but anyway this guy is really strong and he can lift over 400 pounds and that's actually won a lot of competitions in weightlifting for iran and if you guys didn't already think that sajad was a bit of a badass then you should know that in 2016 he went off to syria to fight isis i mean if i was an isis and i see this guy running towards me i'd probably have to change all of my beliefs right there on the spot [\u00a0__\u00a0] being squashed to death by this guy i mean i'm no expert but it looks like this guy's muscles could stop a bullet [\u00a0__\u00a0] maybe even a nuclear missile but in all seriousness this guy is absolutely huge and i have no idea why he wasn't picked to play the incredible hulk can you guys spot the difference anyway here's a video clip of him showing his muscles so coming up next is andre the giant now this one is a little old but he's probably the most famous giant of all time so i had to include him on this list so this guy is from france and he was one of the most famous wrestlers in the world and he was also an actor in a ton of movies the reason this guy is so big is because he's been diagnosed with giantism because of his excess hormones like look at these people they're not small people they're totally normal sized it's just he's absolutely massive and here's a crazy photo i found of his hand holding a beard this guy could literally squash your whole head with his hand to be honest i think it's a good thing that even though he basically has a disability he overcame it and he basically got super famous for it and who knows maybe he even inspired other giants to use his size to their advantage sadly he did die of a heart failure in 1993 which was probably linked to wrestling to be honest and what's really sad about that is he was only 46. anyway here's a few clips of him fighting in the wwe so you can see how insanely big this guy is so next up is brahim takalua so this is another guy he's been diagnosed with giantism and his massive size is crazy enough anyway but what's really interesting about brahim is that he has a specific world record and that's having the world's biggest feat his feet are one foot and three inches long which is taller than the world's shortest woman this guy's from morocco and used to get bullied all of the time for his big feet and his massive height but now he's a celebrity and a big actor and he's even been in a few bollywood movies and you guys know how i mentioned the world's smallest woman earlier yeah he's actually really good friends with her even though they're so different i guess opposites do attract anyway here's a little bit of video of brahim so you can see how giant he really is so next up guy is really special because he's currently the tallest person alive right now he's 251 centimeters tall or eight feet and three inches depending on what system you use anyway the reason he's so big is because of a tumor that basically messed up his hormones and his job's not as interesting as the movie stars the isis killers and the wrestlers this guy is actually a farmer in turkey where he was born and the reason he went into that kind of work is because of how big he is he can carry loads of heavy stuff and also because he was so tall he couldn't fit into a school so we couldn't get an education that's kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] up i mean it's not like he can help it and i know this guy is pretty massive but the school must have been pretty small if it wasn't even eight feet and three inches tall i don't know why this guy didn't try and become a professional basketball player i mean i definitely would but i guess it's up to him anyway here's a few video clips of sultan [Applause] and coming up next is romario dos santos alves now when i tell you this guy's backstory you may think he's kind of stupid and to be honest i totally agree unlike the other giants on this list who didn't choose to be giants well this guy kinda did he basically injected a fluid into his arms to make them absolutely huge but i want to do this at home what were the ingredients well it's a very scientific and biological fluid and the ingredients are oil and alcohol yeah this guy may as well have just gone into mcdonald's and then just injected their oil straight into his arms anyway the reason the guy did this is because he wanted to be the world's biggest bodybuilder well he might be the most circular bodybuilder but he's definitely not the biggest and if you're wondering why i call this guy an idiot it's because he almost died injecting that [\u00a0__\u00a0] into his arms and it's not like he didn't know he could die from it because a few of his friends have done the same thing and they died and he's actually badly bullied by all of the kids in this neighborhood in brazil who call him a beast and a monster i mean i wouldn't go that far but this guy definitely doesn't look normal here's a before and after photo of him showing what alcohol and oil did to him welcome to the 21st century guys so next up is half for julius bjornsson now this guy is super famous and if you've ever watched game of thrones you'll probably know who this guy is this guy from iceland is a professional strong man basketball player and actor wow this guy has a lot of talents and this guy's nickname is the mountain not just because he's from iceland but also because he's a giant he weighs almost 450 pounds and is almost 7 feet tall and what's really weird about this guy is even though he was tall when he was younger he wasn't that big here's a photo of him when he was younger playing basketball and you guys already know how he looks now so yeah this is one insane transformation here's a photo of him and his wife i mean damn even his shopping bag looks almost as big as her here's a few clips of him so you can see how strong this guy really is [Applause] [Music] so coming up next is dennis cyplenkov so this guy from ukraine is another giant who holds a specific world record he has the world's biggest hand in fact his wrists are 9.5 inches thick now he wasn't always massive but when he was a kid he started joining loads of sports clubs and also did wrestling and now at age 32 dennis is around six feet and one inch tall and weighs over 300 pounds and his biceps measure at 25 inches which makes them the largest in ukraine and russia and this guy is one of the best arm wrestlers in the world and i can see why this guy would destroy the other person's hands just by holding them in fact i went to a scientific researcher who made this image to show what would happen to my hands if i tried to arm wrestle this guy [Music] holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm just kidding guys but if you think i'm exaggerating about how big this guy's hands are then here's a video of him breaking walnuts with his bare hands [Music] so coming up next is our lindo de soyuza now this guy's a lot like romario dos santos elvis and that's because he's from brazil as well and he also did the alcohol and oil trick to make his arms massive but this guy used it more but in less places and this is a result he has 29 inch biceps which is the biggest in the world and a lot like romario his friends have also died from doing this [\u00a0__\u00a0] but for some reason he thought well what's more important having freakishly large arms or living well it's pretty [\u00a0__\u00a0] obvious right i need to creep out as many people as possible and a lot like half for julius bondsen he's also nicknamed the mountain is it just me or is this guy like a few of the people on this list rolled into one anyway he says he was inspired by arnold schwarzenegger and ever since he saw him in movies when he was younger he said he felt like he needs to be as big as him now i know a lot of people say arnold schwarzenegger took steroids but i'm pretty sure he never injected jack daniels and mcdonald's cooking oil into his goddamn arms anyway here's a clip so you can see how thick this guy's arms really are and trust me it looks even worse on video [Applause] and next up is yao ming so this is another giant who used his disability of giantism to his advantage and this guy actually took my advice that i gave before and became a basketball player but if he's so famous then what haven't i heard of him well that's because he's mainly famous in china but hey it's still famous and he's also pretty well known in america so he played for the shanghai sharks which is the best basketball team in china and he even played for the nba for around nine years and he played for the houston rockets anyway the reason this guy was a giant was because of some kind of hormone problem which caused him to grow to seven feet and six inches and he looks pretty skinny in these photos but he weighed nearly 350 pounds i mean that's how you know this guy's tall i mean he weighed so much but it wasn't fat it was just because there's so much of him because he's so tall anyway here's a few clips of him being in the mba players in the entire nba and coming up last on this list is vikas upal so this guy was from india and he was india's tallest man and he was an insane eight feet and two inches tall and what sucks is that even though he wanted people to know about him the guinness world records never got around to measuring him i mean is it really that hard i mean if i worked there and i knew about an eight feet tall man i'd make that a priority but anyway his height made his life really hard he could never drive anywhere or get driven anywhere because he was way taller than a car and he had to buy the apartment above his main apartment just so he could stand up because otherwise he had to bend over the whole time and sadly in 2007 he died because of a messed up operation on a brain tumor which wasn't related to his giantism at all but anyway here's a video of the cast to show how insanely tall eight feet is because it's so tall it's kind of hard to just imagine how massive that really is", "channel_id": "UCRyIP2oznv4UPAl1jmKS5kA", "channel_name": "Top 10s", "channel_subscribers": "5130000", "channel_videos": 24, "channel_views":

animals you won't believe actually exist from massive creatures that look photoshopped to large animals that are beyond your imagination recount 10 giant animals you won't believe exist today number 15 giant gippsland earthworm earthworms are quite grotty when you look at them closely but when you bump into this breed it will be difficult to get any closer if you're squeamish about these sorts of crawlers the average earthworm is about a meter in length but these ones can grow 3 times longer and be about three inches in diameter they can easily be confused for an adult snake you won't come across these creepy crawlers often though they only exist deep in the wild around sumaco volcano thought that snake-like worms were creepy wait until you find out what lies deep in the seas stay tuned number 14 giant freshwater stingray stingrays are dangerous enough but when you bump into one of them that's more than four meters long and weighs half a ton then you my friend will have a big problem these creatures are found in the deep sea and most divers wear protective clothing in case they bump into one or any other of the dangerous creatures that live in the waters why are they feared so much these animals are not aggressive in fact if you meet one it'll probably slither away but they have one of the nastiest venoms in the world and this particular oversized breed has the ability to break through your bones with its stinger number 13 japanese spider crab the largest crab in the world and also the most expensive it is almost four meters long when stretched out from claw to claw but it is very unlikely for you to come across any as they live far below the water surface to get one you'll have to go fishing specifically for them they need special equipment as their sharp claws can cause nasty injuries but it seems as though they're tasty enough to be worth the risk if you fancy a japanese spider crab for your next meal then head on over to okinawa and have your dreams come to life for 500 bucks number 12 midas flies no one likes flies they're always on your face if not hovering around your food it's terrible they always make those annoying buzzy sounds these tiny insects can be a nuisance on their own now picture one that's four times the size of a regular fly and a lot more stubborn the midas fly is what we're talking about it can be as long as 10 centimeters in length and have a wingspan of six centimeters but the good thing is that it's only found in arid areas not just anywhere number 11 goliath frog now i don't know about you but i'm not a fan of frogs some people may argue that they're cute and adorable but i just can't see any of that so i prefer to stay away from them but for the purpose of entertaining you i had to research on these massive amphibians that are rare and unique in their own way the goliath frog is the world's largest frog it is able to grow up to 32 centimeters in length and can weigh up to 4 kilograms they can only be found along the equator of western africa these creatures aren't dangerous and can live up to the age of 21 when in captivity they die young in the wild as they fall prey to giant lizards and crocodiles there number 10 chinese giant salamander it is the world's largest amphibian and also the strangest looking creature in the world just to have a closer look at it if you saw one of these in a science fiction movie you'd probably think the producers were being extra creative these large creatures are spectacular there's nothing quite like them unfortunately they are highly endangered and they're almost extinct the ones that exist today don't even grow to their full potential of 2 meters number 9 flemish giant rabbit never did i ever guess a rabbit could ever be as big as a medium-sized dog but they do exist see for yourself the flemish is the world's largest rabbit and can weigh up to 6 kilograms they're large and so adorable and yes you can get one as a pet these giant fluffy bunnies that look unreal are quite popular in the breeding industry and are commonly used to make larger rabbits and hairs however they aren't eaten as they take too long to mature who would even want to feed off these gorgeous little teddy bear animals number eight giant golden crown flying fox are you a fan of bats well if you are you can get the rarest type of mega bats which happens to be the largest in the world at the heart of africa they love to hide in caves in deep forests and will only come out in the dark the wingspan of one is about 2 meters wide but they are in no way aggressive although you may need to handle them with special care as they carry some of the most dangerous diseases on the earth sadly these creatures are also going extinct due to deforestation and poachers number seven giant african snails there are several giant african snails that are mostly found in west africa this one in particular is the largest and can grow up to 21 centimeters in length if you get squeamish about these sorts of creatures then you better wear shoes if you're planning to travel here these snails are voracious when it comes to eating and can cause serious property damage but people still keep them as pets and the brave ones cook and eat them apparently they're a delicacy too i wouldn't try one what about you number six portuguese man of war if this creature doesn't look strange and alien-like to you then i don't know what ever will its appearance happens to be the weirdest in this collection so far so what makes it so strange well it's a colony of different animals working together in unison these animals can't separate from each other or else they'll stop living they have tentacles that will grow up to 50 meters in length and have a deadly venom that caused more than 10 000 stings in australia alone one sting can cause severe pain that can last between one to three hours but it can't terminate you unless you're allergic to the venom you can find most of them in the deep seas across the australian waters number five nomura jellyfish the deep seas have some bizarre creatures that don't look real one of them is this mega jellyfish that when fully grown is longer than the height of a normal man they also weigh more than 200 kilograms and are endemic to the japanese waters they are amazing water creatures but scientists are worried about the rapid increase in their population these creatures are so large and heavy that they cover up so much area giving fishermen a hard time and one time in 2009 they capsized a 10-ton fishing trawler when the crew tried to haul in a net with a couple of fish and dozens of these jellyfish also recently a deep-sea diver was trapped underwater when a couple of jellyfish showed up above him he couldn't swim up to the surface of the water and was almost out of oxygen when he got help from his team the sea authorities in union with the government are currently trying to get a solution for this as it's only getting worse by the day number four large cricket i don't know about you but bugs are not my favorite the small ones are creepy enough now picture an oversized mega cricket showing up in your lawn there are 11 species of this giant which are way larger than the ordinary insects they can grow up to 25 centimeters long yes a whole 25 centimeter long bug thank god they only live in one part of the world you can only find them on small islands off the coast of the main islands in new zealand number three wasabi woodley rat most people see rats and either scream jump or shriek right after the rat dashes away into hiding what if i told you that there's a rat that isn't afraid of human beings whatever you do this rat will stance hall and can even charge it you this out of the ordinary rat is the bosavi wooly rat it was only discovered in 2009 when they were shooting a bbc documentary of the lost land of the volcano the documentary detailed exploration of the volcano crater of mount bosavi and they sure did uncover new creatures these rats that dwell deep in the volcano are 32 inches long and weigh about four pounds they're incredibly docile but carry a ton of diseases with them luckily they can only be found in this region and with that it's now time for today's best pick today's photo was sent to us by a subscriber so if you come across a photo online and want to know more details about it just send it over to us we might even feature it in a future video number two anaconda you must already have a clue about what animal this is if you guessed an anaconda then you'd be right this specific snake was found in india on one fateful morning in an abandoned farm one young boy left his home in the morning to go play with his friends when he came across what could possibly be his worst nightmare he ran back home and called his parents to the scene who later alerted everyone in the village the snake was just lying there as it was going through a shedding process where it can stay for days without moving as it sheds off its outer skin they later on had to find a way to terminate it as it was a real threat to the community the snake was eight meters long and we'd almost 500 pounds the size of this massive creature allowed it to consume up to three human beings in one feeding the wildlife authorities came in and terminated the snake a process that took hours this was the largest anaconda to ever be seen in the region that is prone to large snakes and in the world never has a snake this large been witnessed in history number one asian giant hornet with a wingspan of over three inches the asian giant hornet is the world's largest hornet native to the tropical parts of eastern asia this hornet's venom is so potent that when stung by several at the same time humans can actually cease to exist in fact in 2013 this insect went on a deadly rampage ending the lives of 42 people and injuring another 1 600 others in three chinese cities in short if you ever see this bug run for your life thank you for watching that's all we have time for today stay tuned for more entertaining videos [Music] [Music] you", "channel_id":

made in get 15 off your first order for any cookware you want by following the link down in the description this is a map of the world and you'll notice by looking at it long enough that it's completely full of countries today there's at least 195 countries that exist in the world and at face value it seems like there isn't anywhere to go besides the world's oceans if you want to get away from all of them but that isn't really true if you zoom in close enough and over to the right areas you'll see that about one percent of Earth's land area remains unclaimed by any country entity or person and theoretically this one percent of Earth's land is a lawless uninhabited and wild Zone outside of the control of humanity for all intents and purposes these lands are basically on the same legal footing as the surface of the Moon and yet their actual places right here the you can go and visit right now however most of all this unclaimed land is located right here in Antarctica it's called Mary Birdland and while it's about the same size as Mongolia basically just a frozen Wasteland right now like the rest of Antarctica and well that's the gist of why nobody has ever bothered enough to claim it over 99 of Earth's unclaimed land is all right here which is kinda boring because visiting it is difficult nobody lives anywhere close to it and Antarctica wasn't even discovered until 200 years ago so it all kind of makes sense why nobody would have ever bothered here the other unclaimed lands on the other hand are much more interesting because despite being a lot smaller an area one is located on the continent where Humanity began in the first place which is odd because you'd figure somebody would have gotten around to it already it's located right here in Africa and it's called beer toil despite being sandwiched between Egypt and the north with a population of a hundred million people and Sudan in the South with a population of 43 million people neither government claims beer to wheel and neither does any other country person or entity on the planet not a single person lives here and it's about the size of Luxembourg in Europe because nobody lives here there aren't any roads towns or any development whatsoever it's literally just an empty luxembourg-sized plot of land in the middle of the Sahara Desert full of absolutely nothing but sand and rocks since there isn't any government and there aren't any laws it means that you can basically just show up here and then do whatever you want including attempting to create your own country and many have already tried that in 2014 an American Dad from Virginia showed up and claimed to have established the kingdom of North Sudan in beer to wheel with a flag that was designed by his kids a few months later after that that's a couple Russian guys showed up planted a Russian flag and claimed to have established the creatively named Kingdom of Middle Earth and then in 2017 an Indian guy showed up and claimed to have established the kingdom of Dixit after his last name and planted his own flag all three of these guys's claims to Bear to wheel overlap with one another and there's been some great Twitter squabbling between them in the past and I plan on joining them in the future by claiming beer to wheel as the kingdom of real-life lore or the krll for short of course I have never visited beer to wheel but that hasn't stopped dozens of people from claiming it before in the past and it doesn't stop you from claiming it yourself down in the comments either with your own clever name the point being is that anybody can claim beer to wheel for themselves but actually enforcing those claims is rather difficult because a it's an empty plot of desert in the middle of the Sahara and there aren't any roads leading to it from anywhere else so getting there is quite challenging B it's a hostile desert in the middle of the Sahara with no infrastructure or development and therefore living there is almost impossible and C in order to be a recognized country you actually need a permanent population and infrastructure like airports or roads to get that permanent population there which is hard if you don't have any resources maybe after Jeff Bezos conquer space he'll come after beer to wheel and turn it into his own personal Little Kingdom but how is this even possible in the first place why does this relatively large chunk of unclaimed land on Humanity's original starting continent even exist well for that as with all things we can thank the British and go back a couple hundred years to see why in the early 19th century Egypt was theoretically a vassal of the Ottoman Empire but they were pretty much just completely autonomous and doing their own thing like invading and conquering Sudan without necessarily getting any approval from the Ottomans in Constantinople the Egyptians conquered and then ruled sedan themselves for decades and not exactly being fans of this occupation the local Sudanese started a rebellion against them in the 1870s by that point the Suez Canal had already been built in Egypt and that gave the British Empire a huge Transportation shortcut between their possession of India and the British Isles themselves in British interests in Egypt were growing bigger and bigger with every passing day eventually by 1882 the British were worried that Egypt was falling out of their sphere of influence and determined to hold on to the Suez Canal at all costs and by any means the British invaded and transformed Egypt into a virtual British protectorate but by doing this the British had also just thrust themselves into the Rebellion that was going on in Sudan against the long-standing Egyptian rule because the Egyptian Rule now also meant British rule but what was supposed to just be a quick and easy adventure to shut down the rebellion in the Sudan turned into an 18-year-long Quagmire for both the British and the Egyptians Sudan was completely overrun by the rebel forces and remained that way for 18 years until 1898 when it took a combined British and Egyptian Army equipped with modern machine guns and artillery to reconquer it afterwards Egypt remained effectively a British protectorate while Sudan was transformed into something called a condominium basically just a colony but it was jointly ruled by both the Egyptian and the British however it really all just basically meant that Britain now controlled both countries since Egypt co-ruled Sudan but they were also just a protectorate of Britain at the same time and so the British decided that they needed to draw a border to finally settle where Egypt ended and Sudan began the problem with that was like with every other border the British came up with on foreign continents and between foreign peoples was that a they didn't have satellites and B they didn't really understand or care what they were actually doing the year after the British and Egyptians re-conquered Sudan they came up with this political boundary between the two colonies a straight line across the 22nd parallel of latitude however this line sucked because it was arbitrarily drawn by some guy in London thousands of miles away and if cut directly through land that nomadic tribes used on both sides and it was thought that the tribe who used this area was more culturally Egyptian well the tribe who used this area was more culturally Sudanese so in a very rare instance of the British Empire realizing that their initial border didn't exactly make very much sense they came up with a revised zigzaggy administrative boundary In 1902 that was separate from the political border that was drawn up three years earlier which gave this familiar beer to wheel area to Egypt and this bigger area called the haleb triangle over to Sudan now for decades this never really mattered very much because Egypt and Sudan were both effectively ruled by the British anyway but that began to change by the mid 20th century specifically by 1956 the global attitude toward colonialism had greatly shifted and the British left Egypt in Sudan to themselves both were now freshly independent nations and both of them had to choose between two different choices for what their border could legally be for Egypt option A was the 1899 line which gave them halaib and gave Sudan beard to wheel while option b was the 1902 line which gave them beer to wheel and gave Sudan Hawaii meanwhile for Sudan their choices were just the reverse of these option A was the 1899 line which gave them beer to wheel and gave Egypt halahib while option b was the 1902 line which gave them halaip and gave Egypt beer to wheel in effect both Sudan and Egypt were forced into a rather unique legal situation where they had to choose between either halaib or beer to wheel but absolutely not both It could only be one and naturally just by looking at the map you can understand why both of them wanted to choose halaiib it's about 10 times more land than beer to wheel there were actually about a thousand or so people who lived there compared with Pier to Wheels nobody and most importantly halaib has a nice Coastline along the Red Sea while beer to wheel is completely landlocked halahi is indisputably the more valuable piece of land and as a result Egypt insisted that the true border was the 1899 straight line while Sudan insisted that the true border was the 1902 wiggly line for decades Sudan and Egypt both just shared Hale Eve and kind of administered it together sort of like a condominium this status quo never really became a big issue until 1992 though when the worst possible thing for the Region's geopolitics could have happened you guessed it oil was discovered in the territorial Waters in the Red Sea directly next to halaib so whoever controlled halaib would also control these potential oil reserves and neither Sudan or Egypt were particularly in the mood to share Sudan tried to jump ahead of Egypt by granting exploration rights to a Canadian petroleum company Egypt declared that that was illegal and then using the 1899 border as a pretext they moved in troops to occupy halaiib Sudan retaliated to this by alleged attempting to assassinate Egypt's then president in 1996 while he was out visiting Ethiopia and Egypt retaliated to that by kicking out all Sudanese police and officials from halaib in 2000 with tensions at an all-time high Sudan decided to withdraw all of their officials from the halaib area and it's been de facto controlled by Egypt ever since although Sudan continues to claim it and shows it marked as being a part of Sudan on all official Sudanese Maps Egypt has since tried to strengthen their claim on the land by investing more than 60 million dollars into infrastructure development projects and just a couple years ago in 2019 they also attempted to sell oil and gas exploration rights in the waters of halaeb in the Red Sea to which Sudan made a bunch of legal threats about so yeah that's why beer to wheel exists as a lawless no man's Zone in between them if either Sudan or Egypt moved in to occupy beer to wheel it would immediately mean 4 forfeiting their claim to the much more valuable Hala Eve triangle and neither side has ever been willing to make that sacrifice for more than 65 years now and in no other country could really bother claiming it either because well like I said earlier it's a tiny undeveloped unpopulated and landlocked plot of empty desert full of nothing but sand and rocks in the middle of two other countries but if you're still determined to travel to beer to wheel anyway and claim your own country here you're going to need a few things like roads and airports for transportation along with farms and restaurants to feed your population in order to attract that population with your restaurants you need to actually be able to create some delicious food so people will actually want to come and in order to do that you need to actually have some good cooking equipment and the best place to get some of that is over at Maiden look I really used to hate cooking because prepping and cleaning my tools was tedious and annoying while the food I made wasn't really as good as what I could just get at a restaurant but eventually I got more serious about my cooking and I invested in a collection

Oh, it's so lonely. No! There are tons of conspiracy theories\naround it. Like...like some people think a billionaire\nbuilt this place in case of a zombie apocalypse. Some people think it's like, a\nreligious cult. But most people just wanna move here and\nget away from their problems. Emma (man voice):\nDon't be surprised if one day I just... Ryan:\nNo. But on a real note: this trip is said\nto be extremely dangerous. And locals say: you'd have to be stupid to try to go with no\nexperience. Which really only leaves one man for this job. Hello, hello! Clearly, I'm not prepared for a country\nnamed Iceland. Basically, I'm taking a taxi to a ferry. That ferry is gonna drop me off at an\nisland. And from that island, I'm going to the\nisland with the loneliest house in the world on it. I made it. Lunar ma lunar. Ryan: Did I say that right? Sort of a celebratory...\nPhone: Hairy melons. Ryan:\nOh, dear! It is so cold. I'm wearing shorts. I'm meeting a man named\nlike, Bjarni or something. I don't know how to pronounce his name. Okay, I'm moving a little fast here, so let\nme explain! In 2017, a man named Bjarni uploaded this\nYouTube video. He explores the island and the house and\neverything, but he's only speaking Icelandic. So I reached out to him and he actually\nresponded. And he said he would take me to the island and make me juicy steaks. So that's about all the information I'm\npulling up with. And this is Bjarni. How do you pronounce your name? Bjarni: \"Bjarni\".\nRyan: \"Bear knee\". Bjarni: \"Bjarni\".\nRyan: \"Bertney\". Bjarni: Yeah.\nRyan: So he shows me the boat we're going to\nbe leaving on to go to the island in treacherous waters, might I add. Guys:\nOh! That's a pretty large boat! Not bad. He should be fine on the water. Ryan:\nIt's the small one. Bjarni:\nYou get in front of the boat and you jump. Ryan: Are you serious?\nBjarni: Yes. There's no...there's no pier or coshi. Ryan: Oh!\nBjarni: This is raw nature. Ryan:\nOh, my gosh! Bjarni:\nOh! Ryan: \"Byart ney\". Bjarni: Yow.\nRyan: Bjarni just gave me a bunch of\nclothes, because I wasn't prepared. Oh! Ready. I feel deathly sick to my stomach right now. Not sure if it's because I ate 2 bags of\nIcelandic candy, I haven't pooped in 48 hours, or...I'm so\nscared right now. Can I just say that? And we're going in 10\nminutes. Bjarni:\nHi! Ryan:\nAlright. Oh! It's a cinematic shot. I gotta get the camera. Bjarni: Of course, of course.\nRyan: It's...So, just for the record, we're not\ntaking this boat. Ryan: We're taking that one.\nBjarni: Yeah, the small one. Ryan: Hi!\nRagnar: Hey! How are you doing? Ryan: Ryan.\nRagnar: Ragnar. Ryan:\nRagnar? His name is Ragnar. My life is in the hands of a man who is 100%\nnot afraid of anything. This dude probably eats fear for breakfast. The dark is afraid of him. Bjarni:\nHe'll drive like crazy. Ryan:\nAre you serious?\nMan: And you will be sh***ing yourself on the\nway out. Joi:\nIt's not a good sailing weather. Ryan:\nAh! Love to hear that. The Icelandic ocean is literally freezing. And I also can't swim. So they give us this life vest that gives\nyou... Joi:\n1 hour to live in wintertime. Joi: Iceland cold.\nRyan: Ah, okay.\nJoi: 1 minute if you are not. Ryan: Thank you!\nJoi: Okay. Ryan:\nI couldn't really fly my drone, so I found\nsome free stock footage to, like, portray my experience on the boat to the island. So I just cut back and forth between... I just remembered I forgot to put on my\ngoggles. Ryan: These are yours.\nBjarni: Oh, yeah. Bjarni: Yeah, man.\nRyan: Alright. Ah! I'm terrified. So this is the part of the\nvideo, where I can never really illustrate how scared I am. And, like, just how dangerous\nthis is for someone like me, who has no experience doing anything. But I have to jump off of this boat over the\nicy, deathly waters. I hope I don't fall. Ragnar:\nReady...ready... Jump! Ryan:\nThis is insane. So this is the part where we actually climb\nup the mountain. We're around here. Ragnar: You go first.\nRyan: Okay. Ragnar:\nAnd I'll be behind you. Ryan:\nOkay. Ragnar:\nAlways one hand on the rope. Ryan: Okay.\nRagnar: Great. Just go nice and easy! Go your pace! Ryan:\nSo the camera ends up dying. So I'm just gonna do a quick Photoshop\nexample of what actually happened. So we're climbing up this rope at a very\nsteep angle. I'm terrified. Bjarni's just talking about\njuicy steak. Ragnar is like...Ragnar. He's like a Pokemon or something, I don't\nknow. We're climbing up the mountain. We're\nclimbing up the mountain. And at this point, I started getting ahead\nof Ragnar and Bjarni, and they're like:\n\"Ryan, slow down!\". And I'm like: \"Hey, guys! I can't\nhear you\". Ragnar is like: \"Ryan, watch out!\". And that is the exact moment. I slip and fall into the ocean. And then I levitate out of the water on a...on\na flying shark. The shark...the shark also asked for my go...\nfor the goggles. The orange ones. That was just part of the\ntransaction. We're flying, we're flying. We're flying around the island. He takes me\nover here. He takes me over there. Bjarni can't believe\nhis eyes. Finally, he drops me off right at the top of\nthe mountain. He gives me my goggles back and he leaves. So now you're caught up. I regret this. And there's a lonely house on the other side\nof this mountain. And I've got 2 Icelandic dudes to share it\nwith. Ryan: We made it.\nBjarni & Ragnar: We made it. Ryan:\nSo we made it to the loneliest house in the\nworld. But I can't forget why I'm here. I need to find out who owns this place. How did they build it? How long could you\nsurvive here without leaving? The steaks are high, and they are juicy. Hopefully. I hope that's happening still. So I'm the 11,260...11,265th person to step\nfoot in this house. Bjarni:\nYeah. There's some snack here. Some small steaks. Ryan: Juicy.\nBjarni: Yeah. Ryan:\nThis is the dining and sitting area. Bjarni: Enjoy, my friend!\nRagnar: Everything that's here, was carried up by hand. Ryan:\nLike, how we climbed up. Ragnar: Yep.\nRyan: Oh, my gosh! Ragnar:\nEvery nail, every wood, every stick. Everything was carried up. Ryan:\nI'm in the bedroom right now. I got this shot earlier. This is what it looks like. I can't believe we're... Where am I? This place is lonelier than an Instagram\nmodel in 2013. Like...Okay. Alright. I'm sorry if that was even\nremotely offensive to any sort of demographic or community. Bjarni said he's making\nsome coffee and some pancakes in the morning, so don't mind me if I just teleport to the\nfuture, right? Morning! A brief lesson on the animals of the\nLonely Island. Sheep. Puffin. Seals. A handsome guy. So we're about to eat. But the fog just\ndisappeared for, like, 15 minutes. It's already back. I was able to snag some\npictures, make some TikToks. Emma (man voice):\nDon't be surprised if one day I just... Ryan:\nI found it! Let's go eat breakfast! Ryan: Alright.\nBjarni: Yeah. Ryan:\nBreakfast is served. Ragnar:\nLooking good. Ryan:\nThis looks really good. So the time has finally come. I've built up the confidence to ask if a\nbillionaire owns this place. And why this house is all by itself here. And Bjarni's answer was: that it's not. So this was the first loneliest house in the\nworld. And that's the new one. So this isn't that lonely. There's...there's 2 houses. Oh, my gosh! Bjarni says that most people\nthink this place was built for bird scientists to study the famous puffins. Bjarni:\nThe bird scientist...they keep their stuff\nhere. 6-12 guys stayed here. Ryan:\nReally? Bjarni: Yeah.\nRyan: But that's pretty much all he can tell\nme. So I'm gonna go look for Jeff Bezos in the\npantry. This is the pantry. How many days do you\nguys think you could survive off of this food right here?\nRagnar: About a week, I would think. Ryan:\nA week? This is the workshop? Ragnar:\nYeah. So pretty much here we have paints for\nthe window and all kind of tools, because there's no hardware store in Italy. So we pretty much have everything. Ryan:\nThis is the bathroom. Come on in! Got a sink here. Toothpaste. A mirror with a handsome guy in\nit. A shower. Nice toilet. Haven't used it yet, which...you know... You know what I'm talking about. 48 hours. Yeah, that's still happening. Um...And then out of nowhere, Ragnar got a\ncall from the sailor back home that the seas are pretty calm right now, and we should\nprobably leave. Otherwise, we might be stuck here for\nanother week. And my flight leaves tomorrow, so... Well, one thing's for sure. I know where I'm going in a zombie\napocalypse. Thanks, guys! Thanks, guys!

three clicks to ride you struggles of being fat one two no it was only one it's not my stomach it's my legs it doesn't it's not my stomach yeah what's up right don that thing's massive y'all ready for this roller coaster pretty much all the way in the back right now i can't cook it anymore i don't know if i'm gonna be able to hold on to my phone well unfortunately i was not able to have my phone on the ride they took it from me and i was me and julia's first first uh roller coaster together damn i wanted to record it right so yeah it looks like we're probably not gonna be able to record on the roller coasters there's a seal show in 45 minutes oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] cody you're on in 45 bro is it just me or does this look like lips cody and i just went on a roller coaster julia didn't want to go on this one but it was hilarious because we spent like at least three minutes with like four people trying to push cody's seat down to make him fit into the seat yeah but believe it or not believe it or not it's not because i was fat it's because i was tall like i mean i'm sure fatness probably had something to do with it but the straps wouldn't come over my shoulders like to close all the way it was the funniest [\u00a0__\u00a0] i should have been it did i wish i could have recorded it yeah sixth grade yeah i'm 512. yeah yeah the only reason you look kind of tall is because you're standing hella close to the camera we went on the first roller coaster and we should probably get the fast pass so we did right there was only two other roller coasters open that we could go on yeah so you know three total that we could find no the other ones were closed oh yeah yeah so yeah we were we were only here for about an hour and a half i'd say i went on one ride yeah cody's currently getting a tattoo he's getting the twitch logo on him on his butt you know just a normal day on the job cody successfully got the twitch logo tattooed on his bum how you feeling sitting down on the chair and these tight seats he sat down and he was in so much pain so getting the tattoo it wasn't too bad there were a couple nerves that she hit where like i almost wanted to like kick her in the leg but overall right now it just feels like i got a really bad son kick her in the leg or kick her in the face because your leg was like near her my leg was close to her face kick her in the head that's what i think i said what do you mean um what i meant to say but right now yeah it's 280 pounds pressuring down on like a very very bad sunburn so it hurts a little bit a lot of shading today shading and coloring so did it hurt while you were doing it or no not really no the line work didn't hurt at all the shading obviously hurts a little bit because your skin gets so raw yeah from them doing it but overall it wasn't too bad and it was only like an hour hour and a half cool well now i got the twitch logo attached he said he was gonna do it he got it i was gonna do it i did it i got lance's logo still and now i got the twitch logo so what's next we out here only family only family i'll do it i'll do it so we're at the store right now because cody's camera keeps doing this repeatedly it's literally got a mind of its own we have no idea what is going on yeah that's like you can't even turn it on fully now we're soft so cody and i were going on a board ride and this man's drove up on the side of this edge and tried coming down here on the bike the whole bike flipped and he thinks he popped his his kneecap damn bro this is the same knee that got messed up well remember i told you the story when i was in ebore and the cops kicked it in yeah yeah now he's got [\u00a0__\u00a0] all over his back holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] look at the size of this bee that's like one of those murder hornets yeah it's huge that's crazy you gotta like put your finger by it to like do it justice because they can't really tell how big it is that's a big [\u00a0__\u00a0] bee guys we got a really cute pumpkin family wait we gotta show them a new toaster too yeah so that's lance tonight and that's our three children oh yeah it's it's determined already yeah so we got this new toaster it's a bougie toaster i don't know why we want we had a toaster like this when we had the airbnb in la and we kind of liked it the one that we had in la you can like obviously push it down like a normal toaster or pull it up like normal toaster i thought this was the same one and it's not if you hit toast it goes down on the inside right like that and then there's no lever so you know to make your toast come up you have to hit either toast or if you want you can lift and look so it'll keep heating up and not turn off but you can kind of just get like a preview of what it's looking like and it comes up it's kind of slow though it's a little tedious the one in la was also two little slots yeah this one has four it's nice it's bougie yeah is it necessary no but i think it's cool like when you want just a little bit more it's literally called a pip yeah that's funny and then julia oh my god i've been on this diet for like 12 days right now and of course julie has to somewhat ruin it by buying a bunch of candy and like i love these things they're candy corn they taste phenomenal julia just bought like all these sour strips i got this for decoration but like obviously you're still gonna pick at it yeah and i've been picking at it and i'm i'm so annoyed right now because i don't want to pick at it it's like impossible not to and then she also got some of these decorations over here all these little pumpkins and then this tree lights up which is pretty cool there you go it's so pretty when it's lit up already halloween decorations beginning in september yep fall is my favorite season so julia surprised me with my car getting detailed which i'm super excited about it looks so beautiful right now she got my car detailed for me along with her own car which yours was very dirty and extremely dirty her rims were like a completely different color and like the cup holders were just filled with dirt yeah like crumbs they look so much better now we're gonna check it out it's damn beautiful the rims are so glossy right now i didn't even know you had blue calibers you didn't no blue calipers looking beautiful uh we don't have my key yeah it's clean on the inside look at julia's look at the rims you can see what they actually look like they were like turning black yeah they really were oh my gosh i didn't even notice how much i scraped up my rims oh that's so bad i got some marks that's from when i was like 17 guys so much better thank you baby i appreciate it that's all i got yep so when julia bought my birthday gift it was a little segue go-kart they accidentally sent her the wrong thing at first and instead of returning it we just kept it and we're opening it up for the first time right now it's a segway scooter this thing goes about like 18 miles an hour but we haven't opened it up yet this is our first time so we're still we're setting it up right now we're gonna give it a try pretty excited it looks pretty dope so you just turn it on here a little bell you can change regenerative power recovery it's a weak medium or strong so basically this will help like obviously recharge it i assume that when you're riding it you let off the throttle it'll break itself a little stronger on its own instead of like you breaking it'll help like recharge the battery we're just going to keep that on weak for now i want to put this bit in sport i'm going to do it on here oh there it is drive sport there you go so you have to click this three times oh no two times you can't just hit the go you have to like kick the start and then it'll go from there on out can you just click that thing and it goes yeah when you're riding it you don't have to keep pushing yourself but i mean if you're going one or zero miles per hour and you know it's not gonna go for it it's so quiet how is it that's sports mode and it's pretty slow oh yeah so i just put the regenerative power option all the way up on strong so i'm gonna see how it reacts when i drive what does that mean i'm assuming that it would just like when i let off the throttle it's gonna slow down a lot quicker it'll help like recharge the battery oh yeah you already feel it yeah let off oh it slows down i like that you do yeah i like that so the tesla's like work the same way you can obviously turn that option off my brother uses that option yeah i'm not a big fan but i mean the car kind of like breaks itself because it is like an unnatural thing obviously for a car yeah obviously like you do that in my car um either just roll or obviously i have a lot of gears in my car so and it'll just downshift and then

{"video_id": "N88OE2ZCHBM", "Video Title": "Why Millennials Are Leaving Six-Figure Tech Jobs", "Views": 1113339, "Likes": 18997, "Dislikes": 1040, "Favorites": 0.0, "transcript": "To most workers in the US, the\nperks given to those who work in tech are astounding! $2,000 to\nspend on a vacation anywhere in the world. $2,500 per year for\nstudent loans. $4,000 in baby cash for new parents. That on\ntop of lavish offices decked out with in-house massage parlors,\ngyms and cafeterias serving free, restaurant-quality-food. During the pandemic, in-office,\nperks were replaced by money to furnish home offices, mental\nhealth days, and the freedom to work from home forever. In an\nindustry fraught with competition for the brightest\nminds, perks have become a way to not only attract but also\nretain top talent. The benefits and perks package\nalone, I would say, probably was at least 40 or 50k. This on top of salaries that are\nmultiple times higher than those of other industries. In 2019, the average tech salary\nin the US was $146,000. That's almost three times the median\nsalary of public school workers, who made up the largest industry\nof workers in the country in 2021. But even those swanky office\nspaces, six-figure salaries and unlimited time off are not\nenough to keep some millennials from leaving their tech jobs. I expected kind of this perfect\nwork environment, but it was ultimately still a big company\nwith a lot of those same corporate problems that you get\nin a large company. Hi there. Can you hear me? CNBC spoke to several people who\nleft their lucrative tech jobs to ask them one question. Why? Free team-building trips to\nHawaii and private concerts aside, the tech industry can be\nstressful. I'm curious, was there a moment\nfor you when you started noticing that they'd like some\nof the the perks kind of start losing their luster? A lot of these companies have\nunlimited paid time off. Sounds amazing, right? What happens in\npractice is a lot of people take less than you would otherwise.\nThey serve dinner every day. But they serve it really late. So if\nyou want the dinner, you got to stay at the office. So it's\nthings like that, where it's really, it's a good perk, right?\nBut there's something about it that makes you work more. Aaron Jack landed a coveted job\nat Uber as a software engineer in 2018, after going through an\nintensive coding boot camp in San Francisco, I guess I'd never considered\nthat you can even get into something like Uber or Google. I\nthought those were kind of like reserved for, you know, really\nelite individuals. Jack says that Uber was the best\njob he ever had. But being a part of an industry that thrives\non efficiency and innovation meant the pace could be\nunrelenting, It started out really great.\nBecause I was new. I was just learning everything, right? But\nthe longer I actually stayed, the more yeah, the\nresponsibilities kept kind of increasing on me because I\nbecame a critical member of my team. I felt kind of stuck\nbecause you get motivated to finish and you're like, 'oh, I'm\nstressed to meet this deadline.' But then you're almost on a\ntreadmill where you finish and then you just get a new project. Anna Arsentieva worked as a\nsoftware engineer before leaving in December of 2020. I got my things there. About to\nhead out from the building. I've been here for the last eight\nyears. I'm about to set the alarm and leave for the day, and\nnot for the day but actually leave this time. The company where she worked\ndidn't offer the same perks as the big tech giants, but it did\noffer a good work-life balance. Still, she felt a similar type\nof pressure. What led to the burn out, it was\nnot the amount of hours I was putting in, but the fact that I\nwill have a project, I will get everything I can to make it\nsuccessful, as soon as that project ends, immediately a new\none starts. Jack and Arsentieva are not\nalone. A 2018 survey by Blind, an anonymous workplace chat app,\nfound that over 50% of the close to 11,500 tech workers surveyed\nanswered 'yes,' when asked if they currently suffered from job\nburnout. Compare that to a 2019 survey of 15,000 physicians,\nonly 42% of whom said that they felt burnt out. And the pandemic only seems to\nhave made things worse. So many of my clients found\nthemselves working all the time. Rolling out of bed in the\nmorning, working. Thinking, 'well, I have nowhere to go this\nevening so I might as well just keep working.' Waking up on a\nSaturday, 'I have nothing to do, well, I might as well just keep\ngoing.' There is this understanding of\nyou're being paid well, there's all these perks, there's, you\nknow, stock options. We're giving you a lot, and in\nexchange, you know, we're really requiring you to work those\nextra hours. A 2020 survey by bBind showed\nthat 68% of tech workers felt more burnt out while working\nfrom home than while working from the office. The survey\nincluded over 3000 employees working at companies like\nAmazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Google. Beyond the day to day pressure,\nsome said stagnation played a role in their decision to leave\ntheir tech jobs. I was looking at the trajectory\nof the job over time, and I didn't really see the growth\nopportunities I wanted. In fact, a 2020 survey of more\nthan 4000 tech workers found that following salary, the\nopportunity to learn new skills was the second largest motivator\nto accept a new job offer. The same survey found that 58% of\ntech workers would leave their current job for another one, if\npresented new challenges and problems to solve. Jack imagined\nhis life 10 years into the future. You're still in the same office.\nYou're at the same desk. Have the same chair, same commute.\nSo the details change, but your life is kind of the same. Arsentieva agrees that the\ndesire to keep learning and growing played a part in her\ndecision to leave. In 2019, at the end of the year,\nI was talking with my manager that I want to do something\nelse, I want to learn something else. And it just happened that\nmy interests were not aligned with the interests or the needs\nthat the company had at the time, Arsentieva persevered out of a\nsense of loyalty. Her company had hired her with almost no\nexperience after she immigrated to the U.S. from Europe. But she\nvolunteered to leave when the company downsized due to the\npandemic and spent the next six months studying web development. Claire Shapiro joined Google\nstraight out of college and quickly began pulling in a\nsix-figure salary. But after years in a number of different\nroles, she felt stuck in the tech bubble. I heard from so many other\npeople that had other diverse experiences outside of Google,\nyou know, that you can't really fully appreciate Google, or you\ncan't really understand without having this kind of other\ncontext. It did feel like well, wow, if I don't leave now, I\ncould stay here for the rest of my life. In 2018, Shapiro took a 50% pay\ncut and moved to Belgium for a new position as a design\nconsultant for the Board of Innovation. I thought, you know, I think the\nwork that I am doing is not energizing me to the fullest.\nAnd I think I could probably find that potentially outside of\nGoogle. And I did. The tech industry is built on\nentrepreneurs. So it's no surprise that many of those who\nleave their tech jobs do so to start their own endeavors. That\nwas the case with Morgan DeBaun. I wanted to be an entrepreneur\nfull-time. I wanted to move fast and not get too attached to\nhaving, you know, a nice six-figure income at such a\nyoung age. Like Shapiro, DeBaun started\nworking at Intuit right after college and quickly moved\nthrough the ranks. But working as a product manager, she\nnoticed a blind spot in the products that she was helping to\ndevelop, When we're looking at good\ntarget users as a product manager, which was my first\nrole, you create these user personas, right? And so you\ndescribe the person, you describe the target person, what\nis what do they look like? What do they eat? Where do they shop?\nWhat problems are they solving? What technology do they use?\nBecause you really want to have empathy for the customer. And at\nthe time, it felt like every customer's identity was all the\nsame. It was these white people, middle class, and I'm like,\n'wait, hold on, this can't, this can't be good.' And there's\nclearly a disconnect here. DeBaun says that she liked her\njob, but thought that she could make a bigger impact by founding\nher own company. I don't think that there's any\ntech company that's ever going to put the black audience and\nthe black community and the black customer base as their\ncore demographic that they're solving for. In 2014, she launched Blavity, a\nmedia company geared towards black millennials. Is there anything that tech\ncould have done to keep you specifically in tech? I don't know that there's\nanything that could have kept me working at a big tech company.\nAs a young black woman, I just, I didn't want to fight so many\nfights for the rest of my life. I think that I've made a lot\nmore progress outside of a corporate entity, and been able\nto push a lot more tech companies to be more diverse,\nand empower black people to be in the technology industry and\nbe more equipped to be able to influence these product\ndecisions. Definitely more than I could have been as being a\ngroup director or VP at one of these tech companies. Jack and Shapiro have also\nstruck out on their own. I actually spent the better part\nof, you know, six months developing my own kind of better\ncoding boot camp. Freemote, the freelance developer boot camp,\nthat solved a lot of the problems of the boot camp I went\nto. Although Shapiro still works on\nsome projects with the Board of Innovation, she has also found\nher calling as a freelance product and business design\nconsultant. Right now I'm making less than I\nmade at Google, but that's partially by design. I really am\nprioritizing not as much the salary side and more of the\nwork-life balance and having experience side of it. In an industry as competitive as\ntech, top talent is crucial. And those who leave are doggedly\npursued to return. Google does an excellent job of\nmaintaining connection with people that leave. I had a\ndedicated recruiter that I could call at any time that checked in\nwith me once a year. Asked me how my job was going and asked\nme what I was doing, you know, I get recruited still to come\nback into a big tech company. And I always just like, it makes\nme happy. Because I'm like, 'yes, keep trying to get me back\ninto the system.' But I'm busy! If you didn't have this grand\nvision, do you think that you would have left tech? No, I don't think that I would\nhave left tech if I didn't have a vision or didn't have an\ninternal purpose that was driving me. And going back is certainly\ntempting. For me, I don't think that I\nwould go back unless the sort of structure and the roles that I\nwould want to have kind of came into Google. So who knows. If\nGoogle and I meet again, I won't be mad about it. After a six month hiatus,\nArsentieva got another tech job. This time as a software\nengineering manager at a company that helps match customers with\ncar and health insurance. Do you feel like you are less\nburnt out from this job? Honestly, no. I want to give the\nbest I can. So I put a lot of hours. But it's never asked of\nme. Actually, in reality. My manager told me I should stop\nworking so many hours and take it easy because they want me for\nthe long run, not for me to get burned out again. But stress and its impact on\nmental and physical well being isn't unique to the tech\nindustry. A 2021 survey of 1500 workers from different industry\nsectors found that 52% of the respondents are experiencing\nburnout. Still, the restrictions of the\npast year have given a lot of young tech workers the time to\nthink. I think it's really hard to make\nthis transition into a role where there aren't the perks and\nthe money is very different. But I think now people are, now that\nthey've been away from it for a year that it's an easier\ntransition. For those in tech wondering if\nthey should quit their jobs, Jack says it might be worth the\nrisk. If you're someone in tech, then\nyou have skills that are just intrinsically valuable. You can\nalways get back and do it again.", "channel_id": "UCH5_L3ytGbBziX0CLuYdQ1Q", "channel_name": "CNBC Make It", "channel_subscribers": "1660000", "channel_videos": 24, "channel_views": "410222782", "video_comments": "4940", "video_dislikes": 0, "video_likes": "31130", "video_views": "2048059", "video_title": "Why Millennials Are Leaving Six-Figure Tech Jobs"}

Cause we got you all a steak. (cheering) - They sent the filet mignons. - Yeah, just casually eating\na steak at a pile of money. - If they're gonna be\nfeeding us like this, I could be here like for\nthe rest of the year. - It's now nighttime of the first day and 94 people are still in this. Little do they know I have something in store\nfor them in the morning. Now it's time I introduced the\ntwist at the end of each day we're gonna shrink the\ncircle a little bit. We're gonna bring the new line to... Is that good? I'll do a little bit more. All right, I'll go ahead\nand start filling it - Are you going to do all that? - Nope. When the camera cuts,\nsomeone else will do it. After seeing the new circle,\na few people started to crack - Whoa, whoa, Jimmy, Jimmy. So you're gonna play him\nin rock paper scissors and if you lose you'll get out? - Are you kidding me? - Rock, paper, scissors, chute. Imagine losing $500,000 on a single game of rock paper scissors. - That was the dumbest thing ever. There was no upside. - They just wouldn't stop\ngetting out one after another. It seems like two days in a circle is most people's limits. There's someone sleeping on a cereal box. It's getting serious. - It's nighttime of the second day and Karl decided to start some trouble. - One second. - And I think I just watched one of the guys reach over the line. - No way - No. - That's half a million dollars worth of fruit snacks right there. - I don't know who threw the gummies. - Not only have the\ncontestants spent three days in that circle, but we've spent three days living here. I've been sleeping in that RV. - Morale's getting a little low. - Hope breakfast is\nsomething a little bit better than oatmeal. - Boredom's starting set it. - I don't like oatmeal. It taste like wet cardboard. So this is pretty rough, to be honest. The circle's gonna shrink again. Not looking forward to that. - It's the start of the third day. So we gotta shrink this circle again. - Boo - Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure- I'm not letting Chandler do this again. Chandler made this line so long. This is kind of boring. Now the circle is fully painted in. As you can see, we took a lot\nof space out of this circle. And while we were painting, - Throughout this challenge we realized that if we\ngive people things to do they'll occasionally mess\nup and touch the line which is exactly why we put\nthis soccer goal here to see if we could get some people out. - I'm crossing my fingers. I'm crossing my fingers. - You stepped on it right there. The soccer goal worked. It's the start day of number four. So we gotta shrink the circle again. Chandler, I'm gonna trust you. This is like three more feet. I'll see you when it's done. And there you go. It literally took two\nseconds to fill in the line. - Whoa - That's a lie - It's like magic. - You're lying. - It's been a few hours\nsince someone got out. Karl. - I know what I need to do. I wanted to give you\nguys music to listen to. (alarm clock noise) It's just a 10 hour loop. - Does that make anyone wanna get out? - This is music to my ears because I press snooze Every time. - Do you think anybody's\ngonna leave because of this? - I don't think anybody's\ngonna leave because of this. - So you were saying you would get out for a brand new iPhone? - Yeah. I need a new phone badly. - Here you go. - Ride of into the sunset. - Now that she's out, we're gonna keep playing that. They didn't like the phone alarm sound. So now I'm playing man\nscreaming for ten hours. (cheering) - He got it. - Hey, Karl. - Karl, we just want to talk. Come here Karl. - Get him. - Get out Karl. I got you. - Day five. - It's just a fever dream now. Everyone wakes up screaming. (laughs) - I not going to lie it's slowing down a little bit, but I'm gonna try to keep going. - All right, everybody. You know what time it is? We gotta shrink this circle. Right there. Jump cut. Boom. - I can move now. - The circle keeps getting smaller and people are dropping like flies. - Halfway done. - Grass ball has taken over\nmy entire mental capacity. It's all I can think about - Grass ball. - I'm losing brain cells by the second. I just lost 10. - We started day six like\nusual by shrinking the circle. Since they want me to take a lot, I'm just gonna take a little bit. And then I made a mistake by putting Nolan in charge. - If anybody's butt even\ntouches a blade of grass. You're out. - It's been five seconds and\nhe is already instigating. - New rule. No making fun of Nolan. - The standing challenge\ngot one contestant out. Sorry bro. - Simon says Hit yourself in the face. (laughs) Simon says, do a push up. I can't do a push up without\nmy stomach touching ground. So I'm not doing it. All right, just don't do it then. Your knee touch? Unfortunately your knee\ndid touch the ground. Here's your thousand dollars. (cheering) I have so much power. Is this what Jimmy feels like? - Do you all know why\nthe party lights are on? Because you survived an entire week inside of this circle. To celebrate an entire\nweek inside of this circle. I decided to give them a challenge with the Tesla as a prize. Who wants a Tesla? (cheering) The boys are rolling out a special tarp. Starting now all of you can\nwalk on this thing right here. If you can ride this and touch the Tesla without touching the ground, I'll let you keep it. You're not doing it? - No, that's scary bro. - Okay. Oh, he's getting run. All right everybody's\nback up. Let's see this. Is this it? Is this it? - No. - They're literally engineering a team to win this man a Tesla - All right. - He's on the tire. They're\nabout to launch him. Oh. Did he step out? Okay. Everyone time out. We gotta review footage. We'll be right back. Unfortunately, Corey\ndefinitely stepped on the line. Get rid of this thousand dollars. Give him five thousand dollars. Thank you for putting\nothers above yourself. Then finally, with the help of\nAirrack to give him momentum Jack did the unthinkable. He got it. Get on in. Let me see what you think. - Oh my God. - Look at him. - Going to throw up in my own car. - We had to help. Guy just won a Tesla.\nI'm incredibly proud. It's unbelievable. - Before I brought the\nTesla in we had 36 people. Now we're down to 32. The numbers are dwindling. It's day eight and we needed\nto do something different. So we split the contestants\nup by their shirt colors into quadrants. Today is day number eight. And so far no one's gotten out. So I made this mystery wheel because we need to get some\npeople out who wants to spin it? - Hey, I'll spin it. - Spin it hard though. Not no like half spin. That's exactly what I was looking for. (cheering) - Congratulations. You just\nwon three thousand dollars. - He just spun and won three\ngrand and he's going again. - David. Go for it. All right. Let's see it. He found an infinite money glitch. What the hell. How does he keep doing it? - Jimmy came out saying\nwe gotta get people out. And David is rocking three briefcases. - I just don't think that\ncould have gone any worse. - It's day nine and we lost another person during the evening. But then something happened\nthat I never would've expected. - Oh my God. - Will you marry me? - Yes. - Did you guys see that one coming? - No. - Let's give it up for\nthem. Congratulations. Sounds like we need to get\na briefcase for $10,000 to go towards the wedding. - I've been in the circle\nfor the past nine days, but I could not be happier. - Now. It's time for a\nvery important message. We are too lazy to write the other half, but you should still subscribe. Are you guys subscribed? That's exactly why they're here. Hit the button. You can be in a video. Woo. And now it's time to shrink\nthis circle for the day. All right, instead of shrinking the circle we're expanding the line. But now it's time we introduced the difficult part. Earlier, I asked them to pair up and now we're gonna be duct\ntaping the pairs together for the day. For the rest of the day you\ncould also no longer sit down. - Day nine and guess what they did to us? - Let's go. - Forever together. - Forever, forever - Together forever. - Ha, ha - Oh boy. - How are you feeling? - I don't really like\nmy partner that much. So it's gonna be kind of hard. - Well, this is awkward - Earlier when I was\nexplaining the rules that this happened and I had the replay right here and as you can see, he\nstepped on the line. Neil, man. First he loses a Lamborghini and how half a million dollars. Neil, buddy. I pulled up the footage. It's on the line. I'm sorry, Neil. - All right, I guess I'll take my walk. - Here's two thousand dollars. - Oh, it's still bitter - What's wrong? - We've been final two this\nwhole time from day one. And I was hoping I'd be\nthere with him at the end, but that's the game. - I've never seen Akira\nthis determined before. He looks like a man that's gonna win this - Mark my words that man's\ngonna win this challenge. I promise you. Get it, Akira. - Boys, put the balance\nbeam on that quadrant. Bring it on over. Now this is $10,000 in cash. I'm gonna set it right here. Any takers? 10 grand on the line. - Don't think about how\nthis took nine days. And if you fall, it's all for nothing. Like that. - Let's see if David's luck continues. I assume by your stance,\nyou do gymnastics. - I do, yes. - I can tell you look very calm. All right, that's all you. - It's wiggling. - It's waggling. - Why did we let a gymnast in this circle? - He's counterbalancing. - Oh, oh. (cheering) - David has so far won $19,000\nwithout leaving this circle. If anyone else, not named\nDavid, wants to have a go. Here's another $10,000. And he's off there. - Here's the bin. - That's a good pivot. That's a good pivot. - How is everyone just robbing\nme a money at the moment? - I told you it was easy. (cheering) - Boys, boys, the balance beam's gotta go. That did not go like I thought it would. Here's what the circle\nlooked like at the start with 100 people inside. And this is what it looks\nlike now on day nine with only 25 people. By day 10 we decided to just\nmess up the circle completely. And at this point, our\nluckiest contested, David, had a really strange request. You wanted your magic ball. - I want to ask it if I\nshould get out right now or if I should stick it through. Magic eight ball, should I\nleave the circle right now? Oh, boy. - Indications say yes. Oh, it literally says yes. (cheering) Congratulations. You just\nwant another five grand on top of the 19 grand you won. Anyone else want to shake\nthe magic eight ball? - No, we're good. - He's literally walking away\nwith four briefcases of money. - I'm just glad I could be a part of this. - I'm glad you had fun. Bring out the thing. - The things coming. - Majority of the\nballoons have fun prizes. Some of the balloons have punishments. Punishments included\nbeing double blindfolded or having to wear a giant shoe. - Chandler, which one should I go for? - That one. - You have to do a hundred\npushups before midnight. - Yo, my bad. - Other contestants got prizes. You just want a go-kart. You actually won $2,000. Here you go. Some contestants had a little\ntrouble with the balloons. He won a blanket - I can finally sleep. - You're not worst than Classy. - Yay. You can have goldfish whenever you want. Who actually likes goldfish? - I do. - You gotta tape your feet\nto someone until the morning. You have to sit on the tire\nswing until the morning. And now we are done with the balloon wall. That was fun. - Whoa. - Remember if you touch\nthe ground, you're out. - Sir, yes sir. We're going through the night, baby. We're gonna get this. Wee. - Another long night in the circle. Let's see how they're holding up. - Welcome to my crib. I hate it here. - It's 6:00 AM. You can take your shoe off, but I also have to take\nthe blanket and pillow. - No. I'm sorry. - This is getting ridiculous. Not even the tire swing\nguy got out last night. We need to make things harder. There is 20 of you left and I have 20 little circles of grass. - That's not that much room. - Exactly. And all the remaining\ncontestants have 10 seconds to get on one of them. Boys, fill in the circle. Everyone that gets out\nin the next few minutes I'll give you $10,000 in cash. If not for the next 24\nhours we're dropping it down to two grand. We're not doing anything\nthe rest of the night. We're not really doing much tomorrow. It's just standing. I'd take a deal now while you can. - How many minutes do we have? - Like three or four? Have fun. - What an insane ultimatum. - Nope. - I ain't leaving. - Are people gonna step out for 10 or are people gonna fight\nit out for 24 hours? We'll see. This offer's going to go\naway in three minutes. You've been here so long. - That's rough. That's rough. - He's thinking about it. - Will you throw in a PlayStation 5? - For you, I'll throw it in PlayStation 5. (cheering) - William just stepped out. - William just stepped out. One step closer guys. - We just lost will to the $10,000 offer. - The smile on his face is so big. - These people are tougher than I thought. I wonder if any of them regret\nnot taking the 10 grand. - I just don't know if I could\nforgive myself if I took it. - I should've have took 10,000. Not the smartest decision, but I'm not the smartest man. - I wouldn't have left if\nyou didn't throw the PS5 in. That's a fact - The only thing we can\nreally do now is wait. - Akira, you've been standing\nfor 10 hours straight now. What's happening? - Just can't take it anymore. I gotta think about my future, so. Goodluck, everybody. - I've been standing for 18 hours. I'm not having fun anymore. - Mentally I'm still in it. Physically I'm still in it. - I just threw a whole bunch\nof cold water on myself. I just slapped myself like 20 times. I am not going anywhere. - All right, you guys see the laptop. You see that blade of grass right there. - I see that one. - You got out literally by\na single blade of grass. - Oh, he's falling. (laughs) - It has officially been\n24 hours of standing. How are you liking your little island now? - It's pretty small. - It's time to shrink them even more. - Great. - We got outlines of your feet. As you can see, it's barely\nbigger than his foot. Everyone, you have 10\nseconds to get on them. We can just throw these away. We're trying to get them\ndown to 10 contestants left. Hopefully, this offer\nscares the rest of them out, and we can move on. - If anyone gets out in\nthe next few minutes, I'll give you $10,001. You get an extra dollar\nfor staying another day. Oh, he's already out. Okay. We got one.. Oh, we got two takers. I almost drop tank. Oh we got another one. Let's go. (cheering) Foy, Foy, Foy, Foy. - Come on, Foy. (cheering) - We are now in the top 10 people. You would think she just won the half a million dollars. Look around. There are less than 10 people opposing you and half a million dollars. Goodluck. One of you is winning this. - I was dead tired before this, but I'm 10 now. I could do this for another two days. - Closing in on the end of day 12. And it's time for me to show you guys why this question mark is here. - Why is this question mark here? - You're about to find out. It is time I introduced the\nplot twist of the century. This video is actually two parts and this was just part number one. - No way. - We're gonna be playing tag to see which one of you actually wins the half million dollar. Contestants, make sure you get\na good night's rest tonight because tomorrow will be\nthe most important day of your lives. If you haven't already\nhit that subscribe button.

but one thing is certain without pranks our life would be incredibly boring half of YouTube content would disappear at once but let's not focus on negative things let's talk about social pranks played on unsuspecting bystanders and people who go to public places we believe these pranks are the best so get ready for the most inventive social pranks ever [Music] foreign for a new job people always experience a number of feelings like excitement or anticipation some are afraid of the unknown or tricky questions they will have to answer during an interview the guys from the LG company went one step further they made sure that some of the potential employees would remember this interview for the rest of their lives how did they do it oh it's very simple they decided to show off their high quality TV displays the workers replaced a window with such display oh I don't know and showed a recording of a falling meteor the reaction of the people was priceless the Streets of London always witnessed some exciting things sometimes pedestrians are attacked by tigers sometimes a tentacle emerges from the sewers and sometimes a burning Meteor Falls from the sky wait a minute nothing like this actually happened in London this is just another prank this time organized by Pepsi A couple of years ago the bus stops on Oxford Street were changed the ordinary glass was replaced with a special screen which showed unbelievable augmented reality have you ever thought what you would do if one day a zombie apocalypse happened no well you are lucky you don't think about that stuff because something tells us when people came home after this particular prank they designed the detailed plan of action just in case imagine experiencing something like this a prank called put zombies back was pulled off several years ago in New York you won't guess what was the reason behind such a large-scale prank but we'll tell you the prank was a result of an argument between two companies dish the television operator and the AMC channel the one that makes TV shows about zombies the companies didn't agree on a particular scene and Dish decided to show AMC that there's no place for zombies in New York we do not know who makes advertising pranks in algae but he definitely deserves a raise or at least a bonus because he obviously does his job well this is another ad showing off LG's TV sense and again everything went out of control the ad campaign was named so real it's scary and looking at the reaction of these unfortunate people you understand the name is appropriate an unsuspecting person enters the elevator presses a button size relaxes prepares to wait and then the floor crumbles under his feet scary we would not like to be pranked this way when world famous companies like Paramount Pictures decide to advertise a new movie sometimes their employees come up with let's say very original ideas as a result they turn into very funny and amusing pranks and of course one wouldn't want to become a target of these pranks remember the horror movie The Ring it was released in 2002 and a scary girl crawling out of the TV became a real icon the success of the movie was so great that even people who did not see it recognized the girl in 2017 before the release of the movie Rings they decided to remind people about fear oh my God Adriana oh my God [Applause] we cannot say whether the movie was good you should decide for yourself but the prank victims didn't even need to buy tickets for the movie in order to get scared a job interview again but this time it is completely different usually when you come to a job interview you expect it to be pretty stressful however no one absolutely no one was ready for this position these interviews are over the camera before no let me tell you a little bit about the job to get started with it's not just a job it's sort of probably the most important job the title that we have going right now is director of operations but it's really kind of so much more than that responsibilities and requirements are are really quite extensive first category for the requirements would be Mobility this job requires that you must be able to work standing up most or really all of the time constantly on your feet constantly bending over constantly exerting yourself a high level of stamina for how many like for how many hours 135 hours to unlimited hours a week it's basically 24 hours a day seven days a week I'm sure you'll have a chance from time to time to maybe just sit down here and there yeah Oh you mean like a break yeah uh no there are no breaks available is is that even legal yeah of course yeah many of you might have guessed what kind of job they refer to if you have congrats you are indeed smart if not no worries let's listen some more no lunch you can have lunch but only when the associate is done eating their lunch now this position requires excellent negotiation and interpersonal skill we're really looking for someone that might have a degree in medicine in finance and the culinary arts associate needs constant attention sometimes they have to stay up with an Associate throughout the night being able to work in a chaotic environment if you if you had a life we'd ask you to sort of give that life up no vacations in fact Thanksgiving Christmas New Year's and holidays the workload is going to go up with a happy disposition the applicants are confused they say it's some kind of a twisted joke they wonder if there's even time to sleep and then they hear some more requirements 365 days a year yes no that's that's inhumane Also let's cover the salary the position is going to pay absolutely nothing excuse me no body's doing that for free yeah pro bono completely for free no what if I told you there's someone that actually currently uh holds this position right now billions of people actually who moms [Laughter] this prank was pulled by the company card store in order to remind us all how much mothers do for their children all the applicants were deeply moved and said that they now think about their mothers and how much time and effort they put into their upbringing we hope that after this prank you will also remember your mother hug her or at least call and tell her how much you love her try to imagine yourself in the situation we describe you are sitting at the airport getting ready for departure and suddenly you realize that you are a dangerous wanted criminal you are certain you have not done anything wrong but everyone around you thinks otherwise can you imagine something like this no well in that case let's look at the people who happen to get into this situation [Music] foreign partaking in this prank Navia hired a whole team of people to make newspapers record voice messages and even shoot their own mini news releases thank you foreign you will not believe it but this all is a part of the prank through this prank Navia wanted to promote their new deodorant which protects even in the moments of severe stress physique foreign we do not know about you but we have been firmly convinced for a long time the nun from The Conjuring is the scariest villain of all horror movies [Music] that is why we would not want to be pranked this way this campaign was organized by Roadshow entertainment Under The Motto a good horror movie will scare you even after it is over here's how this prank was pulled off after the movie was shown in the cinema a group of viewers were asked to write a review they were taken to a separate room and asked to wait a bit alone foreign but it was of course not a simple waiting room it was built just six hours before the movie session they used makeup to turn the actress into an exact copy of the nun from the movie scary you bet we are surprised that these guys did not come out of the cinema with white hair but actually some of them even fought back oh my God oh I'm so sorry oh I'm so sorry holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] are you okay I'm so sorry come here oh my God are you okay a very polite guy would any of you try to apologize to the ghost after throwing a bottle at it oh yeah there are no ghosts well at least we think so so this is it for today see you soon and remember treat people around you gently because anyone can become the victim of the next prank [Music] foreign [Music]",

subscribe in the next five seconds or this spider will be in your bed tonight crawling around when you go to sleep hey guys adventure here and in this video we'll be taking a look at some of the best optical illusions ever make sure you watch the video until the end to see an optical illusion that will blow your mind trust me you've never seen anything like this before so don't miss out on that the first optical illusion we have is this train take a look and see is this train moving forwards backwards or is it switching directions this optical illusion is actually crazy because if you focus hard enough you can actually switch the direction that the train is traveling whenever you want the way i do it is that i focus on the furthest left side of the train and it starts moving backwards and when i focus on the furthest right side of the train it starts moving forwards try it out for yourself right now watch the video until the end for 48 hours of good luck the next optical illusion we have is this hallway illusion right now it seems like we're moving down a regular hallway but there's actually a way that we can change the speed we're traveling at basically take both of your hands and cover each side of the screen this will make it seem like you're traveling down the hallway really slow but then if you move your hands and cover the middle of the hallway it will then look like you're moving super fast try both of them out and then even switch between covering the sides of the hallway and then the middle let's check it out next we've got an optical illusion called the bulge effect this one is super interesting basically get super close to your screen right now this will make the white light in the picture seem really bright but then you move back and the white light becomes less bright this is super interesting and you can keep moving forward and back from your screen to make the light bright and then dark over and over again try it out for yourself right now so right now you've got three yellow dots on your screen well there's actually a way that we can make two of these three dots completely disappear stare at any one of these dots and pretty soon after the other two dots will just completely disappear this one is really interesting because you can actually do with any of the dots on the screen try focusing on one of the yellow dots and watch the others vanish then focus on a different dot and then the other two will vanish this one is super interesting so let's check it out next we've got the spinning ballerina illusion take a look at this ballerina what way is she spinning is she spinning clockwise or counterclockwise if you said clockwise or counterclockwise you're right the truth is the ballerina is actually spinning both ways this optical illusion actually allows us to trick our brains into changing the direction she's spinning if we focus hard enough we can make the ballerina spin whatever way we want this one is a little hard but try it out and see if you can make it happen next we've got this pink circle right now it looks like a blank space is appearing whenever one of the pink dots disappears right but the spaces are actually not blank at all if you focus on the black plus sign in the middle of the screen a green circle will appear with the blank spaces were before this one's a little hard to believe but it definitely works so stare at this black symbol in the middle and watch the green dots appear on your screen next we've got this really cool building optical illusion so right now i'm going to show you a picture of a building in color there's a black dot in the middle of the picture i want you to stare at that for 10 seconds after the 10 seconds is over i will show you the same image in black and white if you stare at that black dot for 10 seconds the image should look like it's in color instead of black and white let's check it out so if you stare at the black door in the image you're seeing right now it should be in color the truth is though this image is actually black and white and your brain is tricking you into seeing color don't believe me rewind the video and see for yourself next we've got these two pink circles and a yellow dot in the middle this just seems like a regular photo right well there's actually way we can make these two circles move basically how you do this is you focus on the yellow dot in the middle of the screen then what you do is move your head forwards and backwards from your screen doing this will actually cause the two pink circles to start spinning this one is super interesting and it's really easy to do so try it out right now this next optical illusion is known as the impossible trident focus on the right side of the image it will look like the shape only has two cylindrical ends but then when you focus on the left side of the image it will look like there are three cylindrical ends to this shape this optical illusion is super confusing and will have you wondering how this is even possible take a look at this image but focus on each side of the photo comment below how many ends you think this shape has there's actually an iphone hidden somewhere in this picture but can you find it though only a small percentage of people can actually find the iphone somewhere in this picture i'll give you a little bit to try and find it and then i'll reveal to you where the iphone is in this photo so for those of you that weren't able to find the iphone here it is if you were able to find it though congratulations you're a part of a small percentage of people in the world who are able to find it let me know in the comments if you're able to find the iphone or if it was too hard take a look at this elephant does it have four or five legs this is an optical illusion that has had many people tricked for years and no one has actually been able to figure out how many legs this elephant actually has let me know how many you think in the comments i personally see five but other people say four so this will be interesting take a look at the picture for a few more seconds and let me know next we've got this picture here take a

illusion this one has caused huge debate online as well carefully look at this picture and let me know is the cat going up the stairs or coming down the stairs with this optical illusion it's actually

you have beef with another youtuber the truth is yes i do have beef with another youtuber you got me pregnant we have some really important news to share with you guys yo what are you saying boys and girls i have got a banger for you today now ever since i started doing the real morgues content that you all love there has been one video idea that you've been begging me to do and i have been absolutely bricking it i did not want to do it and today i'm finally doing it answering your assumptions about me however of course there's a twist to make sure i don't the out event can i say that i'm kind of to make sure i don't wimp out of answering any questions for every question that i refuse to answer i have to give away 100 pounds to one of you so yeah make sure you guys watch till the end if you want to see me get absolutely humiliated and possibly win some money let's go you're still a virgin [Music] right are you a virgin brilliant what a great start to the woody video you know what i thought first question tamzin was gonna you know go easy on me kind of get get settled into the video no straight out first question we're starting with that right it's time for the question you all want to know the answer is yes i'm just an innocent child of the lord i'm waiting until marriage i have never actually even touched a female in my life the closest i ever did was i actually held hands with a female once and that's about the most i've done guys so you know i'm getting there i'm getting there guys you know it's baby steps baby steps you are actually five foot nine you know what ladies and gentlemen i have gotten this question so much how tall actually are you for some reason everybody seems to think i'm a bloody the truth is no i'm actually a big blind kidosa six foot four and if you don't believe me i'm gonna go and prove it right ladies and gentlemen it is time for the truth to be revealed as you can see i've got tape measure what are we measuring oh yeah enough i've also got one here are we ready the big reveal [Music] 76 inches that is six foot four hey yay yes let's go i'm actually a giant big monkey boy wait what you're a big lanky boy you can't handle your drink so you got thrown out of oh beach oh no i was really hoping nobody saw okay right i think we need to explain so the assumption is you can't handle your drink drink meaning a certain type of drink i'm not talking about diet coke because i can certainly handle those and you would definitely be correct i can't and the second part of the message he is referring to a few weeks ago when i was on holiday in ibiza i was with tamzin and a few other youtubers at a nice ocean club and drank a lot too much and ended up getting chucked out i think i managed to just about hobble out it wasn't pretty let's just say that something's better [Music] you have beef with another youtuber oh okay okay i see where this is going we're starting to go towards the drama room beef with another youtuber do i or don't i the truth is yes i do have beef with another youtuber and that youtuber is more because she cooked me chicken today and she didn't put sauce on it and it was really plain so yeah she's a dosa you're adopted oh my god okay well you know what talking about morgue's mum you're adopted i guess there's only one way to find out guys i'm i think we're gonna have to go confront her about this this is morgan can you just stop doing that please what's the matter i've got a question for you mom why are you filming because this is serious this is the question that the people want me to ask this is the question that everyone wants to know okay go on what is it am i adopted yes we've covered this loads of times in videos wait what you're adopted why what you're adopted what do you want me to say you were wanted loads of money yeah i did wonder why i was so much better looking are you watching me too morgan of course i'm not being serious oh it's a general yeah you actually enjoyed playing the over-exaggerated morgues okay this is kind of an interesting one i know there'll be some of you that are actually interested about this and the tube is guys it was a weird thing because i don't think i actually i wouldn't say i enjoyed being you know the crazy yo guys it's more today we're gonna be doing ten thousand dollar backflip challenge oh my god yeah i wouldn't say i really enjoyed that but at the same time it was kind of interesting in a way that seeing the response people had to that character and the hate and all the videos and all the controversy and just the reaction to it i was kind of sat there like wow this is actually pretty mad and i almost couldn't believe it myself it was like interesting for me there was this massive uproar about me just being like a a loud doctor in my bloody house with my family yeah it was it was a it was something you're only doing youtube for the money okay this is actually you know this is a pretty intense one am i only doing youtube for money there's been a lot said over the years that you know morgs is just doing it for the money morgue doesn't care about this and that the honest truth is no i know you maybe they're like he's lying he's lying but seriously i started youtube when making money pretty much wasn't even a thing me and my friend started it and i was i was doing it for like three or four years before i even made a penny and i remember my first paycheck was like 80 pounds and i was like i like almost collapsed to the floor like i could not believe it i could not believe that i'd earned 80 pounds you've had more than five girlfriends in your life i hope not morgan that better be lie okay quite an interesting one guys i've had more than five girlfriends in my life true or false the answer is unless we're counting like stuffed animals when i was about six then no i have not in fact not even close to that to be honest you were the one in the side men's villa in ibiza oh my gosh right i have a story for you guys i think it's story time so you may have seen in the sidemen's recent simon sunday they spoke about an incident that happened on holiday while they were in ibiza a couple of people come back to our villa so three guys like couples was there as well couple girls morgues yeah and i'm i'm sat with cal on like the sun lounge at midday our cleaner went into the pool storage room and found a human stool oh no well it could be morgs it could have been molds bro so pretty much i was in ibiza on holiday at the same time right i happened to run into them guys so obviously i went back to this party with all of them everything was good it was a great night however the next day i was informed that somebody had it's in the villa yeah donut number two in the villa now i have to admit it would be some story if i was the donny that did the villa pooh however it was not me friezy told me that he's seen a guy go in to the same room and come out by himself so i think they may have caught the guy so guys i was not the one that did the human stool on the floor you can't grow a proper beard so you keep the lip fluff guys this is supposed to be assumptions this one here is just a violation that is a correct assumption i cannot grow a beard the best i can do is this this mustache if you can even call it that it's pretty much just a few pubes on my lip last summer i was really trying to grow my beard so i just thought if i left it for months then hopefully it would grow however that's not exactly what happened what ended up happening was this absolute monstrosity [Laughter] you are using tamzin for views that is a load of pops that's a lot of books since i returned to youtube i've done 15 videos and tamzin has been in the thumbnail of two of them so yeah once again to everybody saying that soak your mother through a straw well actually crap at football right you know what i am sick of this i'm getting sick of this slander okay everybody's saying i'm actually crap at football clearly you guys aren't believing my words so you know what i'm just gonna do i'm just gonna go outside right now i'm just gonna walk outside and i'm just gonna put the ball down i'm just gonna hit the crossbar first time easy just come with me i'll i'll literally go do it right now right you guys saying i'm trash at football yeah watch this got my ball another crossbar first time [Music] whoa what's that what's that say sorry right now in the comments say sorry right now whoever made that assumption say sorry i'm waiting for you to apologize to me any youtuber out there that wants in a crossbar challenge let's go next assumption i'm out of here next assumption next assumption you're a millionaire hmm okay morg you're a millionaire is this true guys am i a millionaire the question you've all been wanting to know the truth is guys no i'm not i'm not a millionaire i'm a multi-millionaire [Music] you want to go back to cheese string hair right if you don't know what the cheese string hair is that he's referring to take a look at this ah look at the top of his head to be honest guys i couldn't think of anything worse than going back to that like my hair is not amazing at the moment but i think a bald head would be better than that if we're really being honest you know what i'll give you guys a chance if this video can hit 100 000 likes then i will get it back i will get the blonde cheesestring hair back i'm so confident you guys ain't gonna do it no chance no way 100 000 likes do your best you've never been arrested oh oh my gosh all right okay this question actually came up yep uh guys i've never been arrested before i'm afraid fella you have assumed that one wrong and believe it or not it was actually captured on film so yeah let me uh let me play the clip right now morgue's joke you two are under arrest for what what did we do you've been plugging your merch too much it's a youtube cry you don't like this sidemen right so this guy actually reckons that i don't like the sidemen well to be honest i mean apart from them accusing me of in their villa i'm cool with this simon they're they're flipping legends of the youtube scene nothing but respect for those guys they are killing it at the moment i don't know why you guys think i have like beef with loads of youtubers and don't like certain youtubers i don't think i've actually ever been in any youtube beef i'm not the type of guy to start drama maybe i should though you know the views are low seems to work you are never doing merch again right guys this is actually a little bit of a serious one now you may have noticed that my merch store more.co is actually gone it's been gone now for like almost a year to be honest guys the reason why was mainly just because with the whole covered pandemic happening over the past few years i know that for a lot of people money has been really short it just felt a little bit wrong for me to to be kind of like screaming about new merch coming out new merch buy my merch buy my merch wow you know it's kind of tough times for everybody i am actually working on relaunching my merch store with brand new merch more tailored to the new kind of style of my content if that makes sense it's gonna be more grown up merch that kind of anybody can wear more fashionable and there's going to be a lot more work put into it compared to the old merch which was just a little bit more rushed if that makes sense i'm really excited for you to see these new merch designs that i'm working on at the moment they are literally going to be fire you're a sweaty kid who makes videos on random things because you're running out of content yeah pretty much is your body count more than four ah tam's in seriously this one's literally just like a lose-lose if it's yes people are gonna take the piss if it's no people are gonna take the piss i don't even know how to answer this right you know what guys i said at the start of the video if i refuse to answer any of them i give away 100 pounds i'm sorry i'm refute i'm refusing i'm refusing to answer no way i'm going to be giving away 100 pounds 20 you guys right

end and i'll reveal how you can win it now time for the final one the big one you got me pregnant well i mean this is the question that you've all been waiting for you guys want the answer tamzin is

guys as you can see there is now a massive hole in the tv i'm not sure i'm gonna be able to watch anything on that anymore the dares have been crazy so far but i know we can go crazier so idm unspeakable who does some of the craziest pranks and challenges on youtube ibm nico who may have failed to get into morgs fest but he is a big prankster and ibm rebecca zamolo and guess what she

i'm rich okay guys i bet every single person watching this video right now likes oreos they are literally the nicest biscuits in the world if you like oreos guys hit the like button on the video right now but this next tip top guys might ruin oreos forever i can't believe i'm gonna do this but oreo with spread onion in the middle is supposedly good guys he did actually say what he thought about the combination however judging by his face before it cut away i think it's pretty clear what he thought it was not very nice guys for 50 whole pounds i can't turn it down okay guys we've popped the top off the oreo now what we're gonna do is add in the onion look at that look at how flipping thick that is ladies and gentlemen i present to you the ori onion onion three two one go oh he's doing it oh

weirdest thing ever it might be nice but also it might be disgusting hi you can't have five chicken selects please okay guys we've got the kfc the drive-through lady asked me if i wanted any sauce with my strips no it's okay darling because i've got flipping lotus bisque off i don't need any oh guys that looks really gross but we've got some of the biscuit spread on the end three two one i'll tell you what it tastes like martin caramel biscuit and fried chicken and it doesn't taste good guys i didn't know how two things i love so much could be so disgusting together but caramel does not go well with fried chicken obviously i don't know who thought it was a good idea leave this for toast tik tok that's where it belongs darn it i didn't think you'd be able to do that one guys but it means a hundred pounds to morgan okay guys i'm currently in mum's kitchen and i'm whispering because i've got a little bit of a plan check the next food combination tik tok and i think you'll know what it is if you don't put cinnamon on your watermelon you're making a mistake it is the most phenomenal thing you will ever have guys as you know mum absolutely hates cinnamon it is her least favorite thing in the entire world she's done the cinnamon challenge loads of times and almost been to hospital she's drank cinnamon flavored soda each time she hates it so instead of me trying the cinnamon watermelon i'm gonna try and make her hey morgan are you ready to try the next food converse well no mom actually i'm not i know how much you absolutely hate cinnamon so instead of me trying it you're going to i am bloody not morgan maybe this will change your mind 250 pounds i don't kind of need the money i've not made a video since before christmas fine i'll do it you're doing it quickly come on

tea guys this is a sentence i never thought i'd be saying but it's time to make our very own donut pizza i have no words for this anymore as you can see i have cut the doughnut in half and now we are going to squirt on the pizza sauce now that we're finished spreading we're gonna add the pepperoni that's right guys when i have pizza i have it without cheese because i don't like cheese it's not weird okay it's not weird now we're gonna add our little pieces of pepperoni voila a donut pizza this is the strangest thing i've ever seen in my entire life except for the time i walked in a martin and a dress into the oven it goes guys the pizza doughnut has finished cooking and it looks vile for 500 pounds guys this is it three two one go eat it eat it [Music] one of the most difficult things i don't know who the hell said that was a good idea in the tick tock but no that was gross and that means i don't get 500 pounds guys look 500 pounds morgan could have had all he had to do was swallow no you can't keep it hey morgan how are you feeling terrible mum i'm trying to drink this to clear that disgusting taste out of my flipping mouth well morgan you're gonna need that coke for the next

arena we picked six crewmates and two impostors at random the crewmates need to complete the tasks and the impostors need to eliminate them without getting caught the winning team get five thousand dollars each who's gonna win watch to the end is everybody ready to play our mongols in real life i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready very very serious guys three two one go oh my gosh here we go let's pop in here see what's in here martin's behind me go on come on jill i'm gonna let a few people get out of the way first i'm gonna keep an eye on everybody last time i got the dub as the imposter can i get the dub this time ask the crewmate okay so everyone's gone but i can see them on the cameras i'm not sure what's going on there is two impostors this time guys so it is not going to be easy spooky in here oh i don't i'm just going to get started with this task right here i have to find the eminem in this massive pile of skittles there's detectives everywhere these are harder than i thought i'm supposed to be the detective i can see the other detective let me get out of the way from him the problem i've got is i don't know if the detectives are the imposters look who's here i haven't done the task because i'm not laying down face first i'm not laying down face first on that no trust me i'll watch okay okay i'll tell you what like a trap this is it i'm gonna trust you oh my god it's detective why i can spot jail i'm gonna move because there's a detective coming my way she looks okay she looks like she's doing the task he looks very suspicious oh no i'm going away what is he doing you know what guys i'm just gonna try and keep my distance away from the detectives guys so that we can plan what we're going to do i'm trusting genting here so much one two three right i'm just gonna watch him from a distance to make sure he's doing a task because if he isn't doing it that means he's the imposter i've done a task oh wait he stopped doing the task well don't wait up here to do it oh don't you dare go do it i'm waiting i know you're a detective but you could be a fake oh i don't know let me keep out the way of him the task isn't complete yet there's no one around so i'm going to start and blow up these five balloons skittle skittle skittle first one is blue how in the world am i not finding these probably the kindergarteners can do it all one balloon i've got to go downstairs oh detective brown guys i'm never going to complete this flipping task oh i found it oh unbelievable right i think we need to spice this up meeting i call it a meeting okay guys a meeting's been called but as far as i can see everybody's still here so who called it i called it what i was upstairs and i was trying to do the rice and then i kept seeing the two detectives skulking around which two detectives brown detective black ooh doing detective work i would say they just looked sneaky and i felt suspicious part of our job is to detect we're there to watch everybody else okay okay whoa whoa whoa i'm just gonna put him right here because i don't think there is enough information all i'm hearing so far is a load of waffle pretty much i'm hearing a load of nothing obviously just like all of us the detectives are gonna be on the lookout to try and figure out who the imposters are so i think it's pretty normal that they would be looking around however there is always the chance that the detectives could be the imposters so we do have to keep our eyes on them i'm going to vote skip i'm going to skip as well me too it's a skip i just don't know which one to vote for so i'll skip but i'm going to be keeping my eye on those two i know who is safe detective why darren morgan i vote jill i did see martin and he did look suspicious so i do think i'm gonna vote for you i still haven't seen a body until then i can't do my job so i skipped well i haven't seen a body either and that's what we get paid for but at this present moment i'm going to skip i'm going to finish this task that i was doing oh she's following me i am not whoa whoa get back don't trust you i am just chanting just for a second i can prove it's not me why are you why are you why is he going over there though i mean why am i going it's obvious isn't it surely he knows i've completed that task so why is he going over there have you just taken one of those skittles i never get fed when i come and do these guys the strategy is that martin is going to get out he's doing a task what does that tell us let's do this task there's detective brown looking pretty serious oh he's coming through here i'm gonna just do a test now well i'm not really gonna do it i might just follow morgan someone's definitely going to get killed soon i'm just going to start away and play the long game here detective brown is following me i might have to leave the task and go okay guys looks like push-ups has been done i'm going to go and try and find a new task to do this one right so these three tests are done jensen and we pretty much know yeah we we know that i think we are i know that detective white's safe and morgan keep that distance just want to do a task mean no harm did she complete the task or not and that's the thing i've got to watch out for if you're just faking it then that means you could be the imposter i'll tell you this i'm not actually friends with the detectives i'm more of a kind of different type of detective so i kind of don't actually trust him i think it was a detective or jill martin guys i can't find anybody for this task guys i've got to reach 100 000 on mau's ultimate challenge [Music] [Laughter] what so this is unbelievable i've just been caught guys i'm still not really sure who the imposter is i haven't really got suss on anybody i haven't found any dead bodies yet i think i'm going to go to the top floor see if i can find any bodies up there i think it might be martin detective black report report okay who called the meeting and why me i called the meeting again why because i found a body whoa oh my gosh wait who is it who is it it's the only person who's missing daddy oh my gosh the first person has fallen guys and it's my dad but does anybody have any sauce mum where did you find him i found him right here in the meeting room near the card's task did you see anybody round here no this is a weird thing i came down and i didn't see anybody so nobody was here apart from you you must have seen something otherwise that in itself is suspicious before we all start blaming jail b and detective white were upstairs watching detective black we was watching to see if he was gonna do the rise task but he walked away now i have to say i did see jensen and detective white at the start of the game complete a task each at the same time as i completed the skittles eminem task so i'm pretty confident that it's not either of them however if they're saying it might be you detective black then i have no reason to believe that they're lying i think it could be you well at the beginning he was following me around upstairs and i think just because other detectives were there he left me alone same here you were following me well in that case i've got four people all saying they saw the same thing detective black walking around and acting suspicious backing off from people not doing the tasks i'm going to start the voting right here i'm voting detective black and after what i saw there i'm voting detective black i'm voting detective black i say we all vote detective blackout first we're gonna vote detective blackout but if he's not an imposter then i might start voting for martin because i definitely didn't see him all that round i haven't got any evidence yet i've only got suspicions so i have to vote skip at this point well it looks like from me sporting that i'm out here we go guys here we go [Music] guys guys that means that there is six of us left and two imposters we've made a big mistake voting off detective black i can't believe it detective black voted out i'm getting out of the way guys this is getting so intense now i do not want to find myself in a place where i'm alone with anybody or it is way too risky this is getting really intense now we have our first body so now we've got to try and find out who the imposters are trying to keep my distance from everybody look at martin he's suspicious definitely right i've got to also say though that i haven't seen morgan do any tasks he's been following people around logan i we know you're safe so come with us we're just going to stay over here martin why don't you just do some tests or something if you really are a crewmate the rice task isn't done or the bottle flip and i don't think that it's jensen let's see what we can do up here see i definitely think joe is suspicious because she just ran away i have to say you want a little bit sauce i'm just going to stay away keep walking around keep walking morgan keep walking it's so hard to run up a steep hill somebody's around i'm suspicious that detective keeps saying i look suspicious joe's disappearing she's not even doing a task oh he is so sauce now i'm thinking if i follow jill keep my distance and we can maybe find out everybody's sticking together she's escaping from us pretty sure martin is downstairs there he is downstairs just snuck away guys i'm going to go over here on the bottle flip task go everybody's upstairs i think i might go downstairs and see what's going on stay downstairs stay downstairs then we know who's who detective white is going downstairs okay so here's jill okay detective white who do you think it is jensen i think it might be jill and martin she's not even trying to kill me so is she really an imposter could be detective brown he is still definitely not clear detective brown why don't you go do the rice task if you guys watch me do the rice task will i convince you and then we know who the imposters are let's get on it martin's gonna get out the detectives here's martin jensen you go watch detective brown i'm gonna get on with the bottle flip task okay okay this is so difficult it's gonna take so long to do he's gonna kill me isn't he he's gonna kill me guys here we go it's time to do this bottle flip task i am not very good at bottle flipping so this is not going to be easy i really knew it was martin i was right the whole time there's too many people here i think we're almost surrounded just do the chance to stop doing this no do the task ah martin's coming i don't like this one but there's too many people do the task okay do the task i don't like this one jill stay back jail no it'd be sure jensen i've just gone past jensen nobody's gonna okay who called the meeting i did martin why did you call it detective white rock poor dead oh dead another dead body no may she rest in peace or should i say rest in pepperonis we've lost another crewmate there's still two impostors among us martin you need to fill us in what did you see see this is a problem i didn't see anything again this can't be right am i the only one that sees a problem with this first it was mum that saw nothing now it's martin that saw nothing this can't be a coincidence all the detectives are being killed let's vote out martin then we'll vote out jail well before you do that gee i was upstairs with you all of you and i was i yeah i don't think so jensen this is really intense i do find it really suspicious as i said that mum and martin both found a body and both just so happened to stumble across it i'm skipping ask it buzzers are free have a massive decision here if we skip that means the two imposters just need to kill one of us the game is over if we skip i agree morgan since martin called it i say we should vote out him for two reasons one he called it until he's probably the better imposter i pretty much anyone with a brain would vote martin so i vote martin you're saying martin so it'd be a wasted vote for me if i vote for anybody else process of elimination says i've got to vote for martin because you find a dead body don't mean to say that you murdered him i'm gonna vote for martin what would you need me i'm voting for you baldi i saw you on your own i never touched you it's too late martin my vote is cast three runs for martin two for skip it's over mine reveal what you are it all comes down to this it's your loss i told you now it sure was you're ready for this you should be ashamed i knew it i can't believe it i got you martin [Music] all of us remain three crew mates one imposter let's do this right here we go again all right then come on let's go i need to get a little area by myself to chat because i am really really really really suspicious i'm going to keep an eye on jill as much as i can but is that going to be enough do this task do it i can't do this one because you're the imposter do the task and we know you're safe morgan i'm following morgan leave me alone i'm starting to lose track of people a little bit now it could be anywhere martin has been eliminated from the challenge he was voted out martin was the imposter now does that mean that it's mum as well i don't know i still haven't actually caught any dead bodies yet i'm just trying to get to the rice task to do it okay do it i'm gonna get back on with some tasks guys this is not me sabotaging the rice this is just really impossible whoa hang on a sec guys i think it's been sabotaged okay do the ball flips over here then okay i thought jensen said he did this task that means it's been sabotaged that means the imposters sabotaged this task this is insane guys i have no clue who it is i'm pretty sure it's not jensen otherwise i'd be dead now jill just missed two tasks that she could have done this is really tense now i need to find someone does it look like mum's doing much down there guys she's more interested in filming me right now where is everyone i don't know where jensen is okay who was it that called the meat in me i was gonna call the meeting and jensen got his whistle out first so you both saw what happened at the same time what happened then what happened killed detected ground right in front of me it killed detective brown right in front of me you need to make the right choice i've never shut up throughout all this because i was right two vocal two vocals clearly mum thinks it's jensen jensen thinks it's mum they're gonna vote each other here that means this is down to me jensen or mum now i haven't seen mum too much this game however a few minutes before the kill i was upstairs and i did see mum downstairs he was walking around kind of aimlessly but if you're saying the body was found upstairs that's not where jill was exactly morgan that's what i'm saying i was downstairs when it happened i saw him i saw him i saw jensen i'm voting jensen let's just get this over with oh my god morgan you can do the right thing and vote for jail or no offense you could vote for me and be an idiot i vote the imposter which is jill guys i do not know what to do everybody comment down below what should i do should i vote mom should i vote jensen i've gotta move someone or it's game over so i think my head is telling me to vote jill my heart is telling me to vote jensen i am gonna vote for [Music] jensen imposter he knew he was you all the time oh you've made a terrible mistake so terrible sir tired that it lost us the game wait what [Music] what yeah wow big surprise i was the imposter hey massive shout out to laser quest sheffield for letting me film in that

know guys I think I may have made the biggest mistake ever I stupidly agreed to let my girlfriend control my life but 24 hours so for all of the day today a Tamsin is gonna be sending me videos pretty much making me do whatever the hell she wants and Thomson has no filter so this video probably isn't gonna stay peachy very long anyway you guys are probably wondering why I looked so terrible in fact no you guys probably just think I look like that all the time anyway it's because it's currently 9 a.m. and usually I wake up at like 1:00 p.m. for Tamsin has just sent me the first video good morning Morgan as you know I am controlling your life today and usually when you wake up you might have a hot shower but you know I thought maybe you should have an ice cream bar because your lady would probably fall back asleep but if you have an ice cold bar it would definitely keep you awake oh you know what I was thinking maybe it was just a slight chance that she was gonna be nice and not make me do loads of bad things today but no I've only been awake for five minutes and it's already time for an ice bath girlfriend controls my life for 24 hours they said great idea that would be they said well it's not [Music] [Music] okay guys I finally managed to warm up a little bit after that freezing cold bath and change into some clothes but you'll never guess what just happened I have another text from Tamsin and no surprise guys it's another video it's only been about 10 minutes and she may make out the bath what is she gonna make me do now hopefully that wasn't too cold to you but to like switch things up now I think you should wear that chicken question throughout the whole days like no I like small amount the time I believe you should wear it for the rest of the day you know and the thing is we all know what you smell like when you sweat I wouldn't want to be jello Martine sat next year cuz you're gonna reek oh my gosh guys this really isn't getting any berries at first I had sort of a freezing cold ice bar and now I've got to dress like a chicken for the rest of the video you know what guys maybe I can just lie until Tamsin I lost the chicken costume and then I will have to do it open so Morgan mom hi Thompson's just phoned and said I've got to make sure that you get your chicken costume oh for God's sake yeah it's fine no no Tom's in I gave him yeah it said it was gonna put it on so I'm just waiting to see I thought you hate it this is the stupidest costume ever I had to wear this onstage at marks best and I thought I told you guys to burn it after but clearly not it's hot it's itchy I've got to wear it for an entire 24 hours this is gonna be a long day let's see what she's gonna make me do this time see as you're still wearing that chicken costume well you should be because that was my orders mmm I think to go with the theme you should order some KFC but like not owners are I think you should go to the door when a delivery guy comes and still wear your chicken question because I want to see his reaction to a chicken answer in the door you get me oh my gosh not only am I getting humiliated when this stupid posthuman full of you guys now I've got to worry about of a stranger you know at least I get some KFC guys let me order it oh my gosh did you guys know that 60% of you watching are not subscribed to my channel I know luckily guys but please

much to my lovely girlfriend Townsend this is Charlie [Music] maybe a little bit too far I hate you solid though so you know I was kind of justified okay you guys as you can see I'm currently any case of zombies uncles you be trying to hopefully not die on round one like I usually do survive around four paws a close one I'm gonna set let me pause real quick I just got a text that panel be from who I think it is oh no it's another text from comes in and it looks like she sent a video hello Morgan and hope you enjoyed your flavorless salad and because I know you you'll probably like playing your ps4 or your xbox right now however today video games a ban like you're not gonna be playing them it said I want you to stop being lazy and I want you to come on oh my god of the day I think [Music]

hours since Mia mines boxing fire my chicken costume is still drenched in sweat and I think my jaw might be dislocated but I guess we're going to continue with the day Tamsin just takes me a few minutes ago so I guess let's see what she wants me to do next hopefully it doesn't involve boxing so your heads getting a bit long now and it kind of looks like a bird's nest and I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few Nick's in it either so I think that your hair needs a good cut and right just for perfect people to cut your hair yeah Jenna Martin oh my god this video is just getting

okay moving so I know you've probably had a really long day because I made you have an ice bar you been running around as a chicken all day and not only that you have a bad haircut I bet so I was just thinking chickens don't even sleep inside they actually sleep outside so you're gonna have to build a tent to sleep outside oh I think my own girlfriend might actually be trying to kill me all I wanted to do was have a nice relaxing day but instead I'm out here building a flipping Teddy and you know what's the worst part ice I can't get the stupid thing to stay on [Music] okay okay guys

Tamsin and she said this is the last video and she saved the best til last I assumed my best that means best for her so probably worst for me Morgan I know you'll probably have an amazing time in that freezing tent of yours however there's still one more thing I need you to do for me call your ex good luck there's nowhere to do that I don't want to do that put me in the chicken soup maybe do an ice bath yeah whatever that is too far I can't do that right I have to do everything she says for the day so I guess I've got no choice I've just got to grit my teeth and just do it I'm just gonna have to do it guys I'm gonna have to call my ex there goes nothing okay guys as you can see here I've got my exes number right here I'm about to call and just see what happens I have no clue what's gonna

five seconds for one whole week of good luck hey guys adventure here and in this video we'll be taking a look at things only kids can do make sure you watch the video until the end to see a sound that only kids will be able to hear literally no adults can hear this sound so make sure you don't miss out on that also if you're a kid watch this video and see if you can do any of the things in this video alright so the first thing that only kids can do is actually lick their nose this is actually such a rare thing and only some kids can do this this isn't something you can learn either you just have to be born with the long tongue try it out for yourself right now and see if you can lick your tongue this is actually really cool since 99 of adults can't do this but a lot of kids actually can let's check out some footage of some kids who are able to do this also let me know in the comments if you can do this as well the only kids can hear so our hearing actually starts to get worse from the age of 25. this means the older we get the less sounds we're able to hear so i'm actually going to show you a sound that only kids are able to hear this sound is going to be at a high frequency and only kids under the age of 12 should be able to hear this i bet if you play this sound for an adult they literally won't be able to hear anything alright let's take a listen to this sound let me know in the comments if you can hear this all right the next thing that only kids can do is drink water super fast so we all need to drink water to survive but one cool thing about kids is they can drink water a lot faster than adults there's actually some kids who are able to drink a whole bottle of water in literally one to two seconds this definitely looks like it would take a lot of practice to do and it's super impressive let's take a look at a kid all right so that was kids who can drink super fast but another similar thing that kids can do that most adults can't is eat super fast as well i wouldn't recommend trying this though because it looks like it takes a lot of practice there's actually one kid from england who was able to eat a chicken wing in literally one second when he did this his friends were actually completely shocked and they couldn't believe what they had just witnessed let's take a look at this clip of a kid eating super fast a whole chicken wing to the bone in like three seconds or something he loves chicken how many chickens do you think you'll take yourself the next thing that kids can do that most adults can't is actually lick their elbow so most of us probably thought that this was impossible right well there's actually a bunch of kids from all over the world who are able to do this this is a super unique trick because it's not something that you can teach yourself to do you have to be born with the long tongue and short upper arms this is why such a unique thing to do are you able to do this though only one percent of kids are able to do this trick so if you can do it you must be a super unique person let's check out some clips of kids who are able to do this super unique thing keep it straight and do it [Laughter] [Music] this is awesome so i'm showing that i can lick my elbows the next thing that a lot of kids can do that most adults can't is actually tricks with their tongues this includes things such as rolling your tongue and even making unique shapes with your tongue as well this is something that a lot of kids can do but most adults cannot which is really interesting are you able to do cool tricks with your tongue though let's take a look at some girls who are able to do this and then try to see if you can do it for yourself if you can do it let me know in the comments i'm really interested to see if any of you guys are super unique [Music] can you flip it again huh can you flip it the other way you're just getting so much noise to practice yeah the next thing that kids can do that adults can't is actually turn their feet backwards and walk again not all kids can do this but some unique kids can so you actually have to be double jointed to do this if you are double jointed you can literally turn your feet the complete opposite way and actually walk around this sounds super weird and it definitely is weird watching someone else do it a kid ended up making a video on youtube of him doing this and trust me when i say this it's actually super unique let's take a look at this [Music] so the youtuber markiplier is actually able to do this trick as well he learned this when he was a kid and was able to keep doing it when he became an adult let's check out this clip of the popular youtuber markiplier showing off this unique trick he learnt as a kid my feet backwards i think we have to see right yeah no no all right next i've got a bonus clip for you guys so this isn't something that only kids can do because adults can do this too but kids are actually really good at it this unique thing is solving rubik's cube super fast a lot of the world record holders for rubik's cubes are actually really young the reason that they're so good at doing this as well is because they started practicing when they were little kids this is such an impressive skill and it's really satisfying to watch as well are you able to solve a rubik's cube let me know in the comments let's take a look at this eight clip [Applause] so if you thought that was impressive take a look at this three-year-old kid who solved rubik's cube there's literally grown adults who don't know how to solve rubik's cube but this little girl is actually somehow able to do it let's take a look anyway guys that's it for things that kids can do that most adults can't can you do any of the things in this video and also

riddles to solve which you'll need to apply all your logic and detective skills that's a tough challenge but if you're up to it let's start after each riddle you'll have 20 seconds to find a solution however if you need more time don't be too shy simply pause the video alright riddle number one your task is the following empty one jar of milk and one jar of water into a bowl oh wait you couldn't think this would be that simple there are several conditions you must be able to differentiate between the milk and the water you can separate the milk from the water and finally you aren't allowed to use any kinds of dividers to keep these two liquids apart wow that's a task even cinderella didn't have to deal with will you be able to figure out how to separate the inseparable 20 seconds for you to do this [Music] in fact all you need to do is to pour the water into the bowl first and freeze it then after that just add the milk and then you have milk on the rocks riddle number two there's a magician famous for the tricks he performs one of such tricks is staying under the water for 10 minutes however one day john smart challenges the magician saying that he will stay under the water for two minutes longer to say that the magician is surprised is to say nothing he accepts the bet and promises john to give him five thousand dollars if he does beat the record all in all john wins and gets his money how does he manage to do this do you think that john could be practicing not to breathe underwater since childhood or perhaps he's an amphibian what's your idea you have 20 seconds to make up your mind [Music] well to tell you the truth john was cheating just a bit he took a glass filled it with water and held it over his head for 12 minutes yep always read the fine print on the contracts you sign riddle number three sam princeton is so unhappy with his life so frustrated with his boss picking at him and so angry with himself for being too weak to leave his job and start a new life that he shoots himself right between his eyes in the bathroom the bullets are real the revolver is real as well [Music] however in just a second sam goes out of the bathroom alive and unharmed how is it possible hmm that's not a piece of cake or perhaps you've already figured it out if not you still have 20 seconds to use [Music] the thing is that sam didn't shoot at his real self he shot his reflection in the mirror riddle number four in the city where people are keen on brain teasers and riddles four percent of people don't list their phone numbers so if we select 40 random people from the phone directory how many of them will have unlisted numbers oops seems you'll have to apply some knowledge of mathematics here 20 seconds to refresh everything you've ever learned [Music] [Music] the answer may make you indignant you've opened your math school books after all but it's zero percent if the numbers of these 40 people are in the phone directory they are already listed by default [Music] riddle number five you have seven guests at your birthday party and you've gotta figure out how to cut your round birthday cake only three times to make eight equal sized slices seven for your guests and one for you of course time's a ticking and your guests are waiting for their cake so get going [Music] answer well first off you have to cut vertically right down the middle of the cake to make two equal pieces do the same thing but this time horizontally to make four slices your third and final cut should be laterally across the cake which will quickly turn your four slices into eight so how'd you do on this one and no worries we still got tons more riddle number six a blind man had been dreaming of being able to see again for many years this had been his biggest wish after some time his doctor confirmed that he could have an operation that would solve his problem the man couldn't be happier the surgery went well and the man took the train to go home the doctor allowed him to take his bandages off three hours after the operation so the man was so impatient that he did this while still on the train but as soon as he finished he committed a suicide jumping off the train his operation was successful so why did he do this 20 seconds for you to solve this mystery [Music] why could a man whose dream has come true kill himself in fact it was a tragic coincidence when the man opened his bandages the train was going through a dark tunnel that's why the man thought he was still blind and killed himself riddle number seven your friend asks you for a favor and gives you five dollars asking you to buy something to eat something to drink something to feed his cow with and something to plant in his garden at the same time you're allowed to buy just one thing what are you going to buy to eat to drink to feed the cow and to plant wow doesn't your friend think that's a little bit too much do you know the solution to his riddle if not yet you still have 20 seconds [Music] you can go and buy a watermelon you can eat it you can drink it you can feed the cow with the rinds and as for the watermelon seeds you can easily plant them in the garden riddle number eight once a king sentenced a man to death for a crime he had committed however the king was a kind man so he allowed the man to choose the way he would prefer to die but the man was clever and managed to say something that saved him from the capital punishment which death did he choose you have only 20 seconds to figure it out but if you need more time don't forget you can pause the video [Music] [Music] well being a clever man the culprit chose to die of old age riddle number nine two men are standing on the edge of an abyss on a wood board one of them is holding a gun and wants to shoot the other one [Music] but if the second guy falls down the first one will fall into the abyss is there a possible way for one of them to survive who will actually die 20 seconds for you

scariest things i've ever watched hello friends it's me and today we're going to be watching a really spooky video we received an email from an 18 year old girl named leah who thinks there's something horribly wrong with her sister good thing they put a picture because it ain't me i don't feel safe staying with her what yes bark for me i don't know what i'm getting myself into it says that one night her sister came home late and said she was in an accident and her face was covered in bandages stop come pick me up from the hospital i got into an accident just i did this myself i got into a little full body car crash but it's all right her sister has not been acting the same leah says that her sister goes out into the woods for hours every night and when leah asks her sister what she was doing she just stares at her and smiles maybe she like going on walks late at night [Music] just admiring the foliage stop i cannot take this the way she just ran she just came at her like my name is leah and i am also scared this girl's gotta be pretty messed up if her own sister's afraid of her dude you don't know what kind of accident that her sister got in i think we should be more sensitive until we know more about this dude you saw the video she sent us there's something wrong with that girl let's just go to their house okay and try to sit down and talk to both of them i don't know if that's a good idea let's get to the bottom of this dude this place is creepy it's just surrounded by woods let's just go on are you going to be calm let's let's see what's going on in there i can't even see that okay here's the door right here oh we left the door open by the way just come on in hi hi leah hi parker can we come in to talk about your sister maybe right now is not a good time my sister is still recovering we were literally on the phone like hey can we come over today like right now yeah i'm here no answer i mean leo we just drove like three hours if you don't feel safe in your house then we need to come in and talk okay you gotta be really quiet though okay let's go okay leah thank you for letting us sit down to talk to you can you tell us what's going on with your sister listen you need to be really quiet she told me not to have anyone over here why is she shy i get nervous around people why does she want you having anyone over i think she's embarrassed about her face i don't feel safe staying with her what do you mean you don't feel safe with her she's your sister this is creepy hello sister i told you you cannot have anybody over why do we have guests i would have just stayed locked up in my room uh gail right it's nice to meet you uh do you want to sit down and talk with us there's no talking to that dude what's wrong with her do you think she heard me the whole house is silent everything was heard this would be a great time to like leave the house are you sure that's even your sister in there can you tell us more about the accident that she was in she got in a car crash last week and she sent me this me accident be home soon head hurts bad leah did you pick her up from the hospital like that no she walked in the front door like that uh leah can you excuse us for a minute that's weird just hello i'm home i was an accident a few hours ago and i walk too imagine the hospital just lets you go you got a car crash busted up pretty bad heads blow wide open when your car declines at the hospital yeah you go home no problem dude i don't think that's your sister dude what are you talking about that text did not seem normal and she's covering her face how do i even know that's her dude you're acting kind of prejudiced right now all we know is that this girl was in an accident what like last week of course she's going to be acting weird i'm just worried that the accident affected her mentally i mean if you bandaged up and walking around like everything's fine that's weird dude why did her face look like that it was messed up listen i don't want to hear this oh did you see her face she got an accident she looked busted up this guy so i think we might want to go and try to talk to your sister ready yeah gail gayle sorry to just open the door like that but i knocked knox opens the door sorry bro i knocked though uh how are you feeling leave her alone she eat it you see her chewing she got the munchies i know it was uh probably difficult for you to uh get hurt like that and feel alone after but you gotta let us help you is that her jaw cracking no it's a crunchy taco from taco bell mind your business so we were actually talking to leah and she was suggesting that she might not want to stay here tonight do you think that would be better okay sorry i wasn't trying to upset you okay let's go i haven't watched anything creepy in a while and this is just heebie-jeebies man at this point it's getting pretty late uh looks like we need to spend the night here dude i'm not spending the night unless we set up cameras we gotta see what the hell is going on in this place all right whatever let's do it excuse me you spending the night there i'll be in my car if you need me so they set up cameras all around the house let's just put a camera hi uh leah can we just place the camera in your room really quickly uh no you cannot this way i didn't really know the extent of the situation before i got here honestly i just gotta say i just feel like she's going through a lot right now i don't feel safe right now can you stay in my room tonight whoa sir can you stay in my room tonight it's just your sister i don't know like what's with you guys treating her like she's a freak why are you guys treating her like a freak i mean have you seen her usually when you look like that they don't let you leave the hospital she did a diy health kit we get ready to go to sleep but chester hears something from gail's room i think i hear something in gail's room my feet are very itchy who was that who are you talking to now on why are you screaming it's making it worse dude how are you not freaked out by gail why do you not lay off this girl just because her face is different doesn't mean she's different on the inside dude you know she's up to something why else was she in the woods why are you treating this girl like a freak i mean have you seen her i like the way she acted some such she's a little sassy baca okay so they go to sleep our room that's them sleeping in a bed together it reminds me of that game outlast usually i'm not a baby when it comes to these things but i can communicate with you did you just smack a bug on the wall and eat it freak [Applause] she got our mask off her face was healed this whole time [Music] i'm scared hi sisters [Laughter] [Music] how can you go to sleep oh geez that door is creaky i would have woken up immediately with that creaky screaming i would [Music] she was watching me she's doing a lot more than watching i saw her snatch a fist full of hair there's nothing in here listen leah i think you're just having a nightmare or something your sister's not a monster nah you better watch that she's going through a tough time right now we caught you caught in 4k let's just go do you hear that she's screaming again [Music] let's go she stop bro how can you go to sleep after that did y'all not check the cameras i mean if this was happening every night i would have

locker if I click the next button will Eve receive the helmet remove the skin is normal or just a completely different random skin hopefully the helmet is removed Oh genuinely didn't think that would work first attempt have you ever seen the renegade Raider without her helmet on she's got hair under that that's crazy there you go a new og variation but the og renegade Raider yeah she can take you online do anything with it but that there's a thumbs up it's gonna be fire I know it sadly I do not have the area salt trooper on my account hashtag Ripper we're gonna be jumping into season 2 which is night base but a blue Squire here and we know there's a head underneath it but if the helmet is a part of that heads mesh it won't come off you know what we started off seeing someone strong I'm feeling like season 2 is gonna be good as well it's not working for him but don't forget there was two nights in the season to set we can try it on the Royal Knight as well you see the space skin it hasn't worked unfortunately but let's not fret because we do the Black Knight this guy couldn't even tell you if it's a face underneath the helmet but we're gonna take a look Oh what is that my man is a completely black face not even the red eyes to glow through the masker there he is very different to what I expect there you go Dark Knight uncovered I know this wasn't part of the path to pass I know that guys but the red Knight oh my gosh they're both the same they've got no eyes they've got no mouth it's it's just nothing there you go though there is a legit head under both the Black Knight and a red Knight that is crazy season 1 & 2 damn we're gonna power into season 3 missus of great one trust me guys this guy right here rust Lord was in the season 3 battle pass along with all the space themed ones as well I've not tried this you can see the neck of a character so let's see any luck thanks Jonesy Jonesy is also the rust Lord mind blown every time the rust foodist rolling you back in season 3 it was Jonesy doing it guys we have got our man he's the real troll I shouldn't expect that so that's it I'm so glad it worked it's been far more successful many exclusive skins I'm asking let me say that ladies and gentlemen the dark Voyager this guy's made a returned in a sort of reanimated newer version in season X but what about the og season 3 version can we uncover the mask let's give it a go come on come on come on Oh what Jonesy how are you all of these characters at once he's not only the rust Lord he said our voyages well look at him poppin off he's been in all of these suits all of the time this is crazy what about the dark vanguard dot vanguard there we go I mean you asked for unmasking the season bow parson must have been fire so far now the reaper skin there's nothing to really a masculine app but the elite age you know you can already be Marcy Li agents that's that season done guys we're moving on to my favorite season season for a lot of skins in this one which have just like some of their head comfort I'm gonna give it a go and see if we can reveal all of her hair wait wait we've made a pony tail stick out of her head we actually took her how we low-key dimas technique I didn't think that would work or - Wow I'm gonna try Zoey as well it sort of a hair part of a head probably but let's give it a go and you like any luck any luck yeah we got off as well we actually got ha ha this is Kris go so much better than I expect him not even halfway yeah I do have some sad news cuz I can't lie this is the one I was most excited for I wanted to see if it was the Omega skin I just love these skins in season 4 we could obviously customize all of their arm if you go in you can see you could put all of the little bits on it was the first time fortnight never done that oh man it was just so good now if we try and like glitch all their masks off to see their real face give it a go as you see here it just tastes the armor off is disappointing I know we've had some surprise bangers so far we've got so much more to go now moving on to season 5 with the drift skin I think the same thing happens you can see the full armor then a whole set and my dude drift is taking me out on me because I can't get him to take his mask up or anything that's the case of all of those like upgradable star ones unfortunately however this bow pass did have some cool ones like the red line which I'm really excited to try in a mask which could be awesome didn't work the first time I tried yo it was the second time though let's go that is so cool I love it when it worked guys look at that red line no helmet on there you go just for the fun of it I want to see if I can take some Striders hat off like that little like rescue ting on our head walk well it work will it work it worked it actually worked we met a girl I mean it's not crazy I still like it even if it clinches a little bit I'm not gonna bother showing Ragnar up because if you try and do it it just fits him back down to that guys it's not that cool season six thank you for sticking around because we've got some bangers okay this one is amazing as a few fees I've checked you're gonna love this one so where is calamity here we go calamity so with always said the upgradable ones just go back to the bottom that kind of happens that clarity messes up a little bit look at this actually know what first let me show you what she looks like at the basic that's what she looks like basic right ha hair maybe that will come up let's take a look you ready for this guys it's right properly are you ready yeah takes off her hair and it takes off her cowboy hat as well I didn't expect that I guess they coded the hair with that which is kind of crazy I've not tried DJ yonder this is gonna be a first for me will this work this is gonna do something I can see the DJ only the skin not gonna take his helmet off though huh I guess in a new bow pass you kind of know what he looks like under there anyway nightshade is about past skin I've read you wanna try cuz clearly like something on a head right a tomato skin worked my other video I think is to do something no go ahead ain't coming off guys I reckon fable could work this is like last year's Halloween kind of back to pass so it's like weird and wonderful characters for Halloween I feel like this will do something I'm confident you'll do something or not alright nothing nothing is going into where I expect it today dier skin nothing changes so we're moving straight on to season 7 now guys I think this is where a coding star scale of abettor from four nights of glitching off more mass gets harder for us and for cheap it's still a few ones I want to try again the Ice King doesn't do anything the zeniff skin just takes you back down to this guy here I'll try linked but I don't know if you'll do anything at me cool if you took a half let's see if his spacesuit is bad of its links its face suit season 7 they started really wrapping things up however I want to try more obscure ones like Trog I want this to work I think it'd be really cool if it does no we can't see inside the entity yet these are real Yeti this one will be quite cool could we take off like a little hoodie I think season 7 they really started wrapping things up and whoa I take it back ladies and gentlemen or buzz cuts is know what I expected but it's being revealed look it's voice turn on main ones a little more excited bass bass kids try to take a look at that's it let's go alright can we do anything with powder I think I think hello gorgeous could come off why I don't even do some purpose does my mouth default to take the hell whenever the glitch doesn't work we're gonna jump into season eight that means pili pili is that a real banana underneath that banana skid probably to hunt with you properly if this does anything I will literally be mind blown I know yeah I didn't expect it to they master code that is wrong big banana obviously I what was I thinking back to past wise I mean there's nothing really to show you guys it would just go down to this guy this is legitimately the worst t100 bad pass skin ever with like zero customization so nothing Steve here alright these name was biggest disappointments has jumped to season nine these nerves got the rock skin that just defaults back to the rock skin this guy ever face yeah he's got a face as well I mean that this got better and better stopping us from glitching you know we got a try bunker Jonesy can we get all of that crazy long hair off of his head come on Jonesy what have you got for us hey paddle come on game stop with take the elds ultimate Knights now the Black Knight in the red Knight worked well this guy won let's just find out oh is this gonna work what you're gonna see him or we're not going to see you with a helmet on what does that means under the Ultima Knight is simply the knees underneath that one I'm disappointed you know I am genuinely disappointed that one so it's finish off this video I'm returning to this glitch with a brand new chapter to battle past there aren't too many skins you've necessary unmasked in this one you've got some skins with like hats on for example and some of the beginning skins I mean it's pretty much their face however the fusion t100 skin this guy definitely has a mask on crazy thing is this glitch still works and I recorded the star of this video like a month ago or so so ladies and gentleman who wants to see Strine unmask the fusion skin will it work I can't get it to work guys don't work Mong yo will he look so scary look at you go is a better view I can't lie it's a really cool skin I do like your long I'm gonna finish the videos there we pretty much covered every season every revealing many faces lots of success it was really fun probably the last unmasking I'm gonna do but if you do want to see the other ones who I've done a load of other skins you can check them out I'm a fortnight playlist and I'll leave some links on screen here as well give it a big fat thumbs up if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching and now we know their secrets we know what they don't like

to some music to start off the day Lizzy is over here at making eggs once again and she's got mac and cheese for herself dick so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free fuck for free yeah so I was originally gonna have four eggs like I do every day but there was one egg left so we're gonna make five and then you got your boiling water over here for the mac and cheese just thought just don't throw butter in there this time I'm gonna be rocking my new shoes today I didn't even take them out of the box yet man I always feel this way but I always forget to do it whenever I start the day by listening to some music it makes me get in such like a good mood and I don't know it just like makes me feel happy overall I got to start doing that more often just start off the day start listening to some music and get going finally got my eggs about to eat played some good old jams you guys remember this shit I used to play this in my vlogs all the time it's called fade this song is like amazing how's our mac and cheese good hey so Lizzy just pointed this out but somehow I always do this whenever I put on my shirt I always get deodorant on my shirt you guys see that I always manage to do that somehow me and Lizzy really have to go food shopping there's absolutely nothing in this house to eat right now that's why she's eating mac and cheese for breakfast I had eggs but we're out of eggs now too I ate all of them what am I gonna do you can't reach it oh wait wait when your shortest book I was gonna get it but I mean you insisted on China I did try but I guess uh all right Lizzy somehow always gets his necklace tangled up I got this necklace for her like I think like a year ago or something and how is this always happening I don't know I want to wear it but I can't well I don't have a toothpick or anything so I can't well I have these nails and they are the worst thing right now because I can't untangle it or else I would I try so I just came across this website says who was vine star Lansing ten aka Lance Stewart dating does he have any girlfriend okay first off it should be does he have a girl from not any and if you scroll down a little bit we see hey fans have often speculated if he has a girlfriend or if he is gay what do they not watch the videos like like obviously I have a girlfriend I'm so confused right now this website it's such bullshit Frost no yeah never trust this website guys well I guess me Cody and grandmum all look like somebody from recess what are you doing right now you're curling your eyelashes she tried that shit on me before when we did the makeup video and that shit fucking hurts how do you do that every day I can do it out looking it does not hurt at all I guess you're used to it I guess yeah I did do you know what the fuck is on your eyelashes it's a primer oh my god you look like that lady from what's that movie The Hunger Games haha it's a friend where I gotta put them this girl and that's crazy oh stop wearing foundation I hate it I hate when she wears makeup well okay not makeup in general I just I don't like like she doesn't need all this foundation on her she looks fine without it thank you thank you hands because you talk with your head yeah come on man do me a favor it's not wearing foundation how hard weird Oh Lizzy is the only girl that gets mad when you tell her not to wear makeup I don't get it I just think I look better I feel more confident and that's what I'm wearing now I'm worried about my confident but I think she looks better when she doesn't wear all foundation I like when she wears mascara that's a Del Rio I got it correct this time mascara and eyeliner the only thing she needs because it makes her eyes pop and it makes him look I'm gonna call her I guess I'm huggin oh but she doesn't need all that foundation opelu below can bullshit got you I just pulled what I fucking don't grandmom all the time to you as you're sitting here singing scared the crap out of me did you've been doing your makeup for like the past forty minutes bye bye Felicia Cody just got here what are you doing sucking dick trying to just wait for my vlog to upload because the Internet actually in Romeo's is just fucking terrible yeah mine went up today but nobody got my notification YouTube's been fucking up lately if you guys have my notifications turned on and for some reason do not get my vlog notification when it goes off I upload a 4 p.m. Eastern Time every single day or 1 p.m. Pacific time so if you don't get the notification simply go over to my channel and check it out there I don't know why it's been like 40 minutes since my vlog actually went up right now and nobody has gotten a notification yet YouTube's got to get their shit together so Cody was originally gonna go back home to Vegas either tonight or tomorrow but I think Rachel's just gonna head home by herself and Cody is gonna stay at my place for like the next week or so so he can still be enough loves and then I think after that me and Lizzy are actually gonna go up to Vegas to their house because I have to stay here for at least like the next week or so because I have a bunch of meetings lined up and you guys know that I'm gonna be working on a TV show pretty soon probably with the next coming months so a lot of these meetings and I'm going to be going to have to do with something that is going on with the show but I think the TV show is gonna be very exciting for you guys and you should definitely look forward to it so we were just talking about this if you guys remember a couple days ago when we went to the beach at night we were gonna try and roast s'mores on the beach and everything she's shooting me with fucking nuts boat stop your fucker yeah I can't even speak because of you cuz I'm like sitting here trying to dodge oh I'm gonna hide behind Cody you can hit him stop why did I ever let her you that nerd 4head I didn't even get these fucking things ah my impact okay stop let me let me finish speaking so back back to what I was saying tonight we are actually gonna go to that beach again and try and roast s'mores so that appears yeah roast s'mores then the roast marshmallows and make s'mores there we go guys cuz I didn't use the correct terminology for it my socks got new socks these are for my my new shoes that I got and I can use these feather Yeezys to look she's picking up all the freaking nerve bullets now rockin my new shoes today you guys know that I wanted this color scheme for like the longest time got my gray ones over here but these are fucking sick alright so Rachel wanted Dunkin Donuts oh we're all gonna head there now I might pick up something to eat really quick and then I guess we're all gonna go food shopping at Ralph's cuz I like nothing here and we also have to get some supplies like dish detergent toilet paper and a bunch of other stuff everyone's walking but I'm not because I'm a lazy piece of shit Cody wants to get liposuction but only in his tips yeah like it cool it's cool like to have like a big guy like it's like whatever but when your tits look like a female's it's not cool I need to get rid of these thank you yeah well my tits are bigger than my girlfriend's you know I think she likes to grab them I was talking to Kody about this yesterday you know be crazy and you can get like fat removed from your face so you have like a razor sharp jawline but the rest of your body is so fat like how weird would that look I mean it'd be like pretty much me being a catfish you know and I need like my front from hat off like damn he's fucking sexy bottom down is like heavy right I just said I love you to this dude wearing the raincoat and he said shut up I guess some people don't like being loved hey you guys are walking slow I know I love you I love you I know I've mentioned this a lot of times in my videos the past couple of days but Cody do you remember when I busted my ass going across the street on the hoverboard yeah you and everybody else were laughing at me hurting I was the only one on the other side of the street and I was laughing my fucking hat off I pretty much started crying I wish I caught it on here I know everybody was over there the press Jewelry laughing at me I don't understand some people that comment on my video sometimes because I could literally say something as simple as oh it's hot outside I have people to take that as if like I'm complaining at a time I know I complain sometimes in my vlogs but I've tried not too recently as often as I usually do but seriously like something as simple as that something big oh he's complaining but I'm not even complaining but anyway here we are at Dunkin Donuts so there was a lot of people commenting in yesterday's vlog saying that I forgot to add the drone shops and the whole reason that happened was because I finished editing my blog this morning and since was a 40-minute blog I was scared that the vlog wasn't going to go up in time if I had to add in those drone shots because it would have taken me at least like an extra 15 20 minutes to edit the drone shot but I desperately wanted to make sure that I went up and find me again Lizzy a bagel yeah probably gonna get a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel but I just ordered my food and I remembered that I had this gift card in my wallet for probably the past couple months now and I remember only used like one or two times there's 50 bucks on it so I just tried using it now and there was 11 cents on it I mean I saved 11 cents but that's crazy I've had this drill all that time and I didn't even know about it I forgot when your number 424 your order I have so many scrapes on this board that I've accumulated from like the past couple of days when I was busting my ass the other day plate oh c'mon kill it forgets scrape the entire red concrete you do realize we still have doughnuts an exact kind at the house right so why'd you get another one cuz it's brush I will gonna eat my bacon egg and cheese right now just wrapped up eating it is a beautiful day out today probably gonna go swimming later but first we have to go food shopping and get all the supplies Kody what are the odds that you stick your head in that pipe it'll fit like gold dripping out of it gold gold yeah looks like then you can definitely stick your head in that how much are we talking right now I said what are the odds it's a game anat ha ha there's no odds if you buy me a drone the odds highly increase they're building the equinox Jim in here it's all blocked off right now he hacked his pokemon game he's got a Jewish stick so he can go forward if he presses that oh can we oh my gosh that's fine we just wanted to do an elevator he showed us that I thought it was so funny Kody's about to do that so I'm all great yeah Lizzie's making a grocery list and she's writing on a fucking nap because we'd all have paper but yet she has an iPhone right here when you can simply write down notes ha ha ha you did you'd even think of that did you know I like doing it the old-fashioned way you can check it oh you can check them a knife whatever legal one we're headed over to the grocery store right now are we gonna get popsicles again remember that we got like eight different boxes and did the best for the UH the bag Oh a peanut butter they were so fucking good we we were bored one day I was with Cody with this is the time when I was living in my own apartment and we're like fuck we just want popsicles we go to the store and buy like eight different packs of popsicles and just share that like everybody got their own box and when I was when I had my long hair too and I was like holding ten boxes of popsicles it's funny what is the U that they do in this elevator I don't know I've never understood this is this so if you get cold in there you have fired relative on this I guess oh oh Cody and Rachel make a porno yo what how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood well how much I would chuck could chuck as much as a woodchuck fuck a woodchuck could chuck as much as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood that's what series has to you how much dings could a dick-sucker suck if a dick-sucker could suck dick my dick sucked could suck as much the deck of a dicker could fucking lick dicks okay yeah we've been standing here for like 10 minutes now I forgot my keys yeah I'll fuck on you there we go Rachel comes over here and she's like are we taking the mustang mustang are we taking this thing it's a Camaro Camaro Jenni's back she goes oh it's a Camaro come here oh well looks like I need to get gas cuz I'm not doing that today I'm fine know that this place is only like 2 miles around the corner you're gonna walk 2 fucking miles to go grocery shopping and then walk 2 miles with fucking to shit ton of groceries on the way back home we're the same height now but I'm on the steps one step above just give me a kiss the fact that he allowed me to get that close says that you were trying to get that clear if that cart fill it off we can get Kody to sit in it and we'll push them okay why do they do this they like get you by just walking in this door with all these treats like it just makes you want them what the hell is that like a wheel look it's doing 360 oh my gosh gets the worst cart possibly available I do we need fruits I want bananas there we go if you guys saw my snapchat from yesterday you'll know what this is when somebody puts cookies in the freaking fruit section what do you say fruit section but it's nothing about potatoes over there what I'm alone bottom along when one of these is the size of freakin Cody's butt cheek oh my gosh birthday frosting filled Chips Ahoy cookies what they got stuff that like I've never even seen before chewy Chips Ahoy Reese's that looks pretty good chips away red velvet Kody completely jacked our cards and now we have to go back outside and get a new one so we're looking at hot dogs right now and this says cheese dog so I guess the cheese is inside of it that's pretty crazy so I like to get the hot dogs that are made out of chicken and then they add some pork to it so let's get these ones too for three books but they have you get all the cookies whoa peanut butter chocolate shit maybe we'll get some cookies and make them sometimes you guys already know I need to

come back and get it we're gonna get this huge sting of chicken alfredo for a dinner one night I got to run back down to my car really quick as I left all my bags in the car I hate the paper bags they give you because they always rip and tear I have waist dirty or grocery shopping bags in my car so I'm gonna grab them really quick honestly I don't know we're gonna put all this food because there's like no room in my trunk especially because I have my subwoofer in here freaking basketball here's the bags I was talking about I don't know what kind of material they made of it's like some kind of fabric we just got done food shopping Cody has a cart over there because he's staying for the next week so I needed to buy food for himself Cody ended up buying more stuff than we did but he has to buy like deodorant and like extra stuff like that because he's saying yeah yeah okay all right not wrong good luck the elevator wasn't working good luck I don't know what's going on it was just

perfect fit Cody's glasses broke I'm fucking so pissed off right now I'd be fucking pissed Oh like what dude you see how small these screws are what are the chances that this is the fucking abyss

contacts I don't think I brought him with me I do have contacts but I don't think I brought up with like contacts in Las Vegas the air is just so dry so when I put in my contacts it feels like my eyes are getting fucking crusty and it's hard for me to close them yeah I just wear my glasses most of the time they're trying to find a screw right now for his glasses probably not going to happen like I

works you've got yeah a lot of fireworks huh Lance you did it what the fuck Lance you're making it worse get a spoon out the yolk or the egg whites the Kody found the piece to his glasses yeah you have like a really sharp knife and probably not honestly it's gotta be something small enough to play with your penis yes well I don't have anything that small I think we might be going on a board ride later on today so I'm gonna plug all these boards in right now get him charged up so I just hung my 200k plaques up over here I had one over here but I'm just going to replace it with these because I'd rather these be over here so when people first walk in they can see them so now all I need is a 1 million golden plaque and it'll look amazing I'm probably going to change the way these are positioned though I'll figure it out when I get it Kody and Rachel just said they forgot something in my car so that took the car keys and the fob and went downstairs me and Lizzie are gonna play a prank on him really quick so when he comes upstairs I don't have to do this really quick I'm gonna have my camera set up in my room faced at me and Lizzie we're gonna be laying in the bed and it's gonna look like we're shooting a fucking porn or something and Cody is probably gonna flip we're gonna make like moaning sounds it's gonna be pretty funny all right guys so Cody is downstairs right now he should be up here any minute me and Lizzie are going to stage a porn video it's not really happening obviously but we're gonna make it look like it is the prank Cody so I my shirt off right now and Lizzie has a strapless shirt so it looks like she's naked we're gonna hide under these covers and I'm gonna make like moaning sounds and shit so Cody's like what the fuck is going on and I also have a camera set up over here to record his reaction let's see how this turns out so when Cody comes in this is how it's going to look kneel down like this it's gonna look like we're both nude he's gonna fucking flip what the fuck do it worries you are you guys fucking me I fucking walk in here you're fucking mounted on her like fucking Seabiscuit ha ha ha fucking camera camera yo you guys are

yeah I can fucking see that you've got Craig brought you ha ha Oh me and Lizzy just pranked the fuck out of Cody you're a piece of shit I had two cameras set up because I didn't intend on Cody actually fucking vlogging that shit so I just need to make sure I got his facial reaction I think everything in the fucking vlog no matter what it is he actually recorded it so I could probably use his footage in my fucking video cuz I come up here and I hear fucking porn sounds you don't think that I'm gonna fucking record that even if you guys really were fucking regardless I still would have fucked that up that's just a type of asshole that I am well anyway Cody's making food right now what do you start off I'm gonna make some crab Russell literally walked in as we were doing a fucking porn prank like he walked in at the very end of it he just comes over doing he just comes here to eat we were probably we were playing a prank on Cody acting like we're making a porno it work yeah he was like freaking out I'm gonna eat some hot dogs for dinner and then in about an hour we're probably gonna end up heading over to the beach cuz it tastes like an hour to get there anyway we gotta get wood and s'more items just got done eating let's see if they're ready to leave are you guys ready to leave oh yeah ready to leave yeah leg out Dan the pool areas poppin today so we're about to leave to go to the beach right now I'm gonna bring my crew neck and Lizzie's got the other one we got two of them we're gonna be twinning later on tonight so when it gets cold I can just throw this on so

my shirt let me sit the crewneck hey I like this one the best yeah alright now we're both pouring it I put mine on I don't feel like carrying it around the whole time I don't think so did I get a

look a holiday or something it's not man it's packed fall practice is the weekend if we would've came on like a weekday would have to be in their ninth I didn't have any Witter yeah the other night wasn't that bad but we got fucked over wood and all thing I had wood in my pants but we're twinning right now when the u-haul truck has a fucking a lien on it this Lexus is clean this shit looks nice we're trying to get a fire pit right now they just made their own maybe we can I don't know what to do alright so these nice people over there are gonna let us use part of their fire pit so we're just gonna go get our wood that we have right now and bring it over there but they got little kids and stuff over there so it looks like floaties not Curson yeah but like I don't care I mean it's so nice that they're letting us use their fire pit cuz it's crazy panic so crowded reason we would never find it we should have brought a fire pit yeah but then we would have to go buy one it's just a pain in the ass I can't stand walking in sand with shoes these are gonna be dirty as hell and have a bunch of sin on the dump out of these yeah I know they're all playing spike ball over there you guys know that I got that game it was sent to me from the actual company I mean Lizzie tried playing it and we fucking failed so bad we were terrible at it but there was only two of us she they had like four people over there so it's probably a lot easier with that many people at the fire would put down where to get out the s'more stuff right now Cody and Russell are gonna be having a beer that's probably why they don't want you doing that in the sand because there's flares going like everywhere you're laying down a blanket right also down that view is so gorgeous oh my god we've got my graham cracker worth hey he's a chocolate on there about the rose my marshmallow is ready oh it's blowing towards me wow dude that hurts hailey oh my gosh my hands on fire dude all the hair just burn off my hand

did you hit your target aw shit amazing I want another one but the wind blowing towards us I know I burnt my hair all just a random dog running around everywhere where you going everyone's chilling right now Russell and Cody are playing Pokemon go bunch of people over there Bioware how they're gonna be multiple yeah no damn those things are brightest fuck they were like blinding me we are walking down to the beach area right now check out the water I don't know we're bored I'm on the compound yeah it's a pretty cool night this this flashlight is blinding me oh there we go I'm losing it

wood still on fire as he's dragging it over there so we're leaving the beach right now I'm probably gonna end up dumping out like a pound of sand for my shoes when I go home I'm probably gonna empty out a pound of tea for my bladder that's cute fuck it so random thing over there is a public bathroom I want to know the other day there grew I saw this in English I know me too man it's terrible Lizzy had to go in the bathroom and go pee and this is what she does she's just like hangs this thing around my neck cody has to sit in the back seat now walking backwards well you got to seize now

they're all coming out yeah I saw a few earlier I got a shower like there they are why are these things what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] yo I am so close to canceling this lease I'm so close how do they come here and spray so much bug killing stuff and they're still here yeah I don't know what's up guys how you guys doing today so right now as you can see Lizzy was just complaining about there's little net things I don't know what they are we seem to have gotten rid of the ant problem but these little gnats they're actually like bigger than that sore little flies I have no idea what they are they keep coming off what are you doing hiding I'll be able to show them yeah well we have a person coming up right now that's gonna take a look and we're gonna try and clear it out but seriously like this has been such a problem ever since I got back to this apartment it's just like kind of getting annoying because we've had them come up about four or five times we're ready to try and solve this problem and it's still an issue you probably can't see it but Lizzy caught one in this bag of the squirming around right now it's a little black dot what it got out of the bag you know what they are they're butthole eaters they're gonna eat you [\u00a0__\u00a0] alive play it's like you [\u00a0__\u00a0] wake up and your balls missing I'm playing around but bro what are these things I have no idea I've never seen them before they're like bigger than that so but not as big as what all right where you saying these things I see it it's like blending and they usually come out of the sink area see those three holes into the sink I like killed so many of them before they all come out of there already so we just had the guy come up here and he said he's gonna pump some bleach into the sink in a couple of hours they're actually called sewage flies and they keep coming up from in the sewage so it's like I don't know what we can do about the situation but they're gonna try and fix it but he was also mentioning something about like our air conditioning to me and Lizzy completely agreed on like it's always freezing in my room but it never gets cold out in here or in that room so what they're trying to do is lower the air-conditioning in this room and make it a little bit colder out here when you have the air-conditioning running because there's been a bunch of people complaining about that as well I haven't even said a word because I just thought that's how it was designed or because there's a lot of light getting through in here which is making it hot because we have all these windows wrapping around but if they get that problem fixed that's awesome because it's always freezing cold in our bedroom at night time and we wake up freezing but it will be like just normal out here it feels like noise and it's weird like if we leave the apartment like tonight when we leave we'll leave these doors open so it ventilates out here and it still doesn't Beverly do anything like it's still hot out here and freezing in the night yeah it just doesn't make any sense so they said they're gonna work on that too which is pretty cool because I didn't even complain about that and here we are time to eat hmm did you purposely make a small one no sorry for anything like that little chocolate chip popping up pancakes two days in a row down but they're pretty damn good she puts chocolate tips on normal as always hey that's not nice well you I just realized that the last thing I recorded was breakfast which was like three hours ago so I'm finally picking back up the camera right now Lizzie is currently on a phone call I think she wanted to do some type of video I'm gonna help her out with that and then right after that I should probably start getting ready because I have this event to go to tonight it's like this Halloween haunted trail thing I'm not really sure they have a red carpet that they're calling it a black heart but I guess just because it's like Halloween themed and then apparently they have all these mazes and trails and rides and stuff that we get to go on so I think that would be pretty cool and it would it'll definitely be awesome vlog footage sure you guys Oh Lizzie actually wants to try at least two videos next week she was uploading like every Thursday before but you want to upload one one day right now and she wanted to do the cinnamon challenge cuz she's never done it before I've done it a few times before I should be pretty funny we just have to go to the store really quick grab some smells like rotten in this Walgreens you smell it yeah it's like a lot I don't know what it is but we got to cinnamon now and you ready for this you see she doesn't know what she's expected it's pretty bad my board just keeps rocking back and forth it probably can't get stable it's like slowing down now so we're headed downstairs right now to do the cinnamon challenge outside because we don't want to do with my apartments gonna make a mess but he's bringing a friggin ladle I think she's gonna go extreme with this and might go full-out Tom you yeah but you saw what happy to do so I like them so before we start this challenge I prepared some cups of water every guess that know she's gonna need it how you feeling do you like cinnamon anymore nah we're in the process right now trying to clean it up thank you for helping me but pops I like the new president I know and it's not working that well it would be very nice if we had a hose right now no lie guys we've been going back and forth with these cups probably refilling them about 15 20 times already just to try and get it down the drain you don't feel good it was pretty funny so since we're trying to clean it up over here or lance and I are trying to fill this big bucket up and down the bucket so we're good now hopefully hopefully it's nice to take ten years to fill up though I know because low this thing's filling up not even like halfway yeah not even a quarter I don't feel like waiting all this time so let's see if this does the trick or not do a little bit better I think it just spreaded it over everywhere you don't feel good but from that challenge messed up your stomach I'm gonna have to come back down to like I'm gonna get like a broom or something she just randomly found this bucket under the sink in here under this drawer I guess you are covered in cinnamon like it's all over you know I told her I was like don't sit down don't do anything just go get in the shower real quick like everything she touches smells like cinnamon right now there's so bad we have a guy here right now trying to figure out the situation in the bathroom trying to get those bugs out me and Lizzy just got all dressed and ready once again we are running late to this event I didn't know that it was an hour and a half drive away I thought it was gonna be like 30 minutes so I didn't think we're gonna be late at all and now we're late so we got a rush out the door I usually always check in the morning before I go to an event or something how long it's gonna take me to get there and just I just so happened that today I didn't and usually like any event that I go to is at least within like 30 or 40 minutes away but didn't expect it to be over an hour and a half drive so we definitely can get ahead over there right now it's 6:10 right now it's an hour-and-a-half Drive it's supposed to start at 7:30 so we're not too late we might make it in time I'm not really sure though somebody drew in the back of my car Lance is my [\u00a0__\u00a0] dad with a bigger penis next to the smaller one yeah I really need to get a car wash y'all getting ready to go because you have like no time to finish get it ready cuz I dude came in there and then you have to like edit part of your video really quick yeah because she usually takes forever to get ready but she had to rush this time she we couldn't be in that bathroom and we couldn't use this things for like the next hour anyway because of the products that they put inside there to try and kill those bugs and everything yeah crush our boy look at all that traffic holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh my god there's nothing like la traffic that's for sure Lizzie's playing George's song and this is the image that popped up for it dang I'm George you're looking fresh yo this is one sad a song I feel like I wanna cry it's weirdest folk look she's crying I told you this homestead is [\u00a0__\u00a0] look she's crying from it know for all those like a really sad song so we're supposed to begin there around 750 I'm pretty sure they food there which is good because I'm starving you pretty hungry thirsty you guys can't really see it that well cuz this mini van just pulled in front of me but there's a bunch of lights wrapped around all those trees that's pretty cool okay there you go you guys can see a little bit better now so when they told me there was gonna be rides there I thought it was just like little maze trails and [\u00a0__\u00a0] like they actually have like full-blown like roller coasters and everything it's just cool that's awesome actually going all of this - I hope this is where we're actually going because like it says turn 2.5 miles so I'm pretty sure this is it so I mean it says knots or whatever that's what we're going yeah all right so we finally made it here after like an hour and 50 minutes but I got checking right now and then we're supposed to take a shuttle over to like the area where we're supposed to be at all right here we go we just got to the event now we got to check in we're just gonna go in this little shuttle thing would you say you're cold yeah but we just drove an hour and a half away so that's Hollywood we're talking to our driver right now and he's saying that it's like a pretty scary friggin maze this is like a whole theme park I'd even know because I've never been here before but it's gonna be pretty fun Oh somebody was like that's that visor I'm getting recognized all over the place already it's one of the workers that recognized me back there I know you do but we're not supposed to be saying anything oh it's all good man no worries no worries what uh we're getting off right here yeah you're killing no way I got it I thought we gotta go over to the carpet wait how do I oh yeah scared chilli she's grabbing she's so scared yeah well guess so I went through the red carpet right now and I also did like two interviews over there they tried giving me like rap or something I'm terrible at rapping unless it's like a song I already know but just like freestyle I'm so bad but they've so much food here we're about to dive in we haven't eaten so long so it's gonna be awesome look at this insane ice sculpture that is so cool it's literally ice like you touch it and water's coming off yeah we're onion chips cheeseburger sliders oh it's kinda like a little chicken sandwich I'm down you get to make your own little sliders pretty cool I'm gonna get some mustard on top of this some ketchup oh boy this chicken sandwich is amazing on the love right now we got a bunch of desserts over here brownies cakes chocolate chip cookies no way oh my gosh this food is so good here this cheesecake kind of tastes like candy corn that's pretty good I just like ate everything here I swear you guys had like one of everything actually I had three the chicken sandwiches too they were really good so not only do we get to go through the mazes we get to go on all the rides as well which is really cool and we have these passes which get us in the front of the line so we got the way yeah that's awesome I hate waiting in lines for like roller coasters and stuff so it's a plus so we just talked to them over there and we actually can go in right now is we're going to enter through the park so we can go through and all the mazes so dark you really can't see much you guys can't see me but almost scary people that's your favorite place I'm so full right now I know you're gonna end up getting it before you leave say you all you will you got scared how do you what's your folder we're trying to find some rides going right now I wouldn't go

make it rain how many people are scaring her you're like he's gonna come up to you that's it don't cut my finger they do what I do it's this pretty funny he's gonna watch your baka like 24/7 did not get scared we're gonna try and go on this roller coaster right here you got a runner you got a runner [Music] that's funny look she's still running what's not bro what's going on man [Music] damn I should be hired here so we're going into some type of pride right now it's like a Ouija board so it should be pretty interesting I guess it's all gonna move around itself you gone first it says knock on the door oh god they're closing it I think they're like a session right now so he's got to wait really quick now we're going in okay so dark in here but I'm not allowed a recording here guys oh my here's our Ouija boards I wasn't allowed to record and every guy she got scared of [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah there was like a legitimate Ouija board in front of us I said I feel kind of sketchy because I was like I know I'm not supposed to play with these things but it was pretty fun then I go on this little pyramid thing right now I'm gonna try and slog it I don't know if I can but I tried these thinkers was too tight she's gotta fix a to loosen it for here we go I've never logged one i roller coaster before I'm gonna hold this camera tight and [\u00a0__\u00a0] there we go like mommy how many pushes I'm gonna get my arm listen once we go on this thing next this thing makes me so dizzy last time I went on one of these I felt like throwing up yeah they're fun as hell don't get me wrong but especially my stomach right now but they're closing in on her I remember when I was younger I went to the scary maze and like it wasn't scary at all to me it was scaring a bunch of other people but they were getting mad because I wasn't getting scared at all they actually picked me off by my net they're not supposed to do that yeah I mean of course that scared me but yeah they're not supposed to do that but I was like I was literally maka demos oh oh oh I was like 10 years old I [\u00a0__\u00a0] ha ha there's it go I'm pretty ah the second I started according it slows down it was going pretty high before I'm gonna get an outside seat so I can see what's going on so right here I'm so sketched out about recording a half the time I feel like I'm gonna lose my camera I feel like she's gonna be the one that throws up all over the ride there we go all right so my battery died while I was on that ride it was super fun though I definitely felt like I was about to throw up all the time at the very end I think it was like when I stopped recording because like battery died I realized how high we were we'll just folks when the cameras are it's all good no I love I love you so glad we ran into a few fans let's up guys they wanted us to go on a maze with them well we haven't been in in databases yet so we're gonna go on one now ran into another family name he said she gets my alerts or my notifications every time I thank you just me oh I feel special got some more fans wazzup guys they wants to be in the vlog early but you guys got a chance to my mom do you speak on my news you're not [\u00a0__\u00a0] he's on stilts what is going on here yeah so many fans coming up so she gonna be getting mobs out here but I love it it's awesome yeah it's really cool we're trying to make it our way over to a maze right now it's a clown made I think I feel like when you hold a camera like that slip them in it down it's like people aren't yeah but here's the thing this is how it usually happens like one person comes up to me that everyone else is like who's that and they all like form around it oh yeah it's definitely the block camera it happens every time every time I pull this out people like wait we just went into this maze hey you can't see me John Cena snowing look at that that's so cool damn girl let me get that number they don't want something rain rod right now drinking no idea what this is what is going on here that is so [\u00a0__\u00a0] cool I cannot bring my phone guys that was the funnest roller coaster I've ever been on 82 miles an hour and 2.5 secondly 32.3 I keep [\u00a0__\u00a0] it up but it is so fast I wish my heart rate was that quick holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] that thing is insane it was so fun yeah you literally get whiplash it launches no like you're not even going up hill you don't see butterflies in your own straight it is so cool this was sick so it's not like a broom come back down and then you go up backwards on there and come back down we're gonna go on this roller coaster now guys look at all the veins popping out of my head what the heck that is so funny I think we're done with roller coasters now you okay so basically what happened was we were just on a roller coaster and like right as we're going off and about to go down her like [\u00a0__\u00a0] what is it called like the belt that buckle the seat belt thing that comes over you like gay bow and it lifts it up and she was freaking the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah because there was that there's a thing that pulls down on you and then there's like another seat belt partner just scared the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of us but though seriously that was [\u00a0__\u00a0] scary I was scared for you so I think we're done with roller coasters for the night we're trying to find our way back to the VIP event area right now so we can take a shuttle back to our car we want to head out right now but we have no idea where to go we're completely lost she's running

Queen Ball 100 grand okay let's be realistic glance one of my squeal\nO'Neal I don't grow I care a lot about my hair\nI don't think you would accept any kind of money to shave his head would you dye\nyour hair at least I'm gonna dye mine I'm gonna do it that color that I showed\nyou what should I say here know if you want he wants to do it like all white it\nwasn't why it was like it's not bleach it's not Italy no they'd like it's like\nwhite gray oma it's like a dynamite over tight\ngrandpa hair yeah like I already have gray hair so I figured I might as well\njust make them all match you know when you have gray hair when they're like 24\nyears old couple answer I love a stressful life okay if that's not\nyou do revolution lately all right let me hit this music you know it's weird\nnow that I think about it I told you guys earlier in the vlog that nothing\nreally weird has happened since yesterday since I got all those\nscratches on my back and I specifically said after I got the scratches on my\nback of our world cup I was like you know I'm done like I'm done playing with\nthe Ouija board I'm not playing with that anymore and I'm also not doing that\nnotepad thing I haven't touched it since then and nothing really weird has\nhappened since then I mean of course the poster fell this morning it keeps\nfalling I have no idea why but like nothing too outlandish or weird has gone\non since then so I'm wondering if maybe that's all I have to do is just stop\nplaying with the Ouija board entirely or with the notepad thing entirely but I\nmean it's still not adding up to me because even after we got the priest I\nstopped playing with the Ouija board for like a day and still weird stuff was\nhappening I'm not really sure this is just all like really confusing tonight\njust wrapped up the meeting went pretty well but I wanted to tell you guys about\nsomething that Aidan just texted me so we posted a video and in the frame of\nhis video you can see like a ghost figure on the door behind him it's\nreally freaky and if you look close enough it like you can see the\nfull-blown face it's pretty weird I know it's a little hard to see cuz there's a\nglare but you guys see the face right there where my thumb is it's like a\nghost figure face it's so weird this is like completely zoomed in on the picture\nto see like hair and then you see like a face

What is that scary Demon Monster alien thing um? That's it. I am throwing away all the mirrors in the house. I don't know how I'm gonna do it makeup anymore Makeup less I be 2017 in effect I Hope I don't do that my subscribers this picture is already creepy enough Even before I tell you what the creepy part is if you look to the left. There's a little head with glowing eyes And I'm never gonna be able to sleep again this this house and this picture needs to be burned to the ground I I can't care if you guys ever watch to play any horror games you guys know that. I'm a pussy I got scared really easy this make sure looks normal, right? Wrong look at the creepy guy look she just dissed and she's like Let me try to be cute And there's a goddamn killer cook to clown in the bathroom. Just just chill in there It's not even just a guy it's a killer clown. I was her I would have ran I would have been other supposedly did you just did you just do but what is she doing in? that park At that time of night she died having playing Pokemon go I'm straight-up judging her now this picture is one of those things that when you see it. You see it now I'm going to show you so it shows you should show you guys you guys can see it, too. This is a forehead This is a nose. This is a mouth. This is a changes in the eye that in a year Isn't that crazy? I wonder this is photo Chopper. This is legit this elephant ear because that is cool imagine It's like I had a face on my ear And I was just like a kind of face and then I could have a safe And I could have face and I could have face I could watch this on the side and stick I take it back I don't want a face in my ear. My ears already weird enough. It's ripped So I got my own problems and Kids this is how I divorced your mother's with this man thinking because this is really creepy so she's facing the camera We can see her face to face in the camera, but if you look in Reflection there's another woman staring behind the back what type of sorcery is this this is straight-up creepy? You guys see the face. I don't know maybe a sec somehow the reflection is bouncing off of something else I don't know how this happened. I love this movie look at Mr.. Potato. He's so funny Julie's a Midi and Beyond So a bunch of innocent toys right wrong, you're wondering why they look shocked You don't want to know what they're looking at But you totally look at the shadow to find out I guess we know why andy stopped playing with his toy I don't know wasn't actually in the movie Did I miss this as a kid or was this photoshopped in I'm not? I'm not sure rip childhood Why don't you guys come in take a seat? I gained up just for you decorated the house nothing neither ordinary here This one actually took me a long time to go out. I'm like what's wrong with this picture. I looked everywhere couldn't find it and then and Then when you look behind that table right here right or left you see something really creepy already separately or you Don't right guys. I got you Now this one might just be the trick of the fog But it kind of looks like there's a little girl on that swing Did I see it and it's like moving - it could be the wind or it could be a kid ghosts Never fall off or a kid goes that told us that that's how all horror movies. Go wrong. The door's locked I've learned dodged from values my horror movies. Did I've watched you oh Man this one has to be photoshopped that looks like a killer clown down there again. I wouldn't go down there Not in a million unless that clown had some chocolate Chocolate banana, Milkshake, I did not my new favorite thing Where do I get one? that's Like my two favorite things it like in a drink in a cold drinking home have ever made a video without talking about food This happened yet, just a regular old construction site except for that ghost boy in front of the tire Do you see him so I will draw him with my mouth jeez his head This is his body Whose legs I still think that is for sure you guys will even go I? Don't personally if someone were to prove it to me. I would believe it. I take that back. I don't want any proof okay I'm like I don't believe in ghosts, but I also don't want to fuck around we go likes it It's like so hypocritical because I don't believe in ghosts But I would never play with in a ouija board though because of that fear that what if I'm wrong, right? You don't want to take the chance because that's how all the whore would go wrong - you always get this person Who's like this isn't true, and then they do some like crazy black magic stuff? And then it is true so like I just think it's better to be safe than sorry You know at first is a really nice picture of Riri and Katy Perry Getting a little cozy in award show And then you see some I don't know who that is we see some creepy guy with his face so like sideways under their seats Nothing harboring is so library having to deal with how brought some people under the seat. We see doing external coupler scripts Not okay, dude get the hell out of there get out of there moment. They're having a moment in you're ruining it This is the worst photo bomb ever like that person is DC. Like. She really wanted to get in that photo. She's like I'm Richard squeeze my face into this Tiny Little Gap that they've left and like the way she's looking like she's like like I'll grudge like I'm crazy. I can't okay Maybe she's rebus on me. Maybe she trying to be scary oh My God wait until you guys see this one like you're perfect all of friendship looks of these girls Every day having an amazing time they're out partying and then you had the one girl Who's puking in the picture like she just can't figure her life out? She couldn't wait until after the photo like she literally Projectile vomiting did this photo was taken a couple seconds later one girl would have had vomit all over herself and would have not been Happy don't you realize when the puke is coming like don't you have that moment? You're like? I don't feel so well maybe I should go to the toilet and Puke and toilets. Oh look how pretty they look I think it's prom night Maybe and if this is a really cute picture until you see this creepy, Demon Looking thing looking look look look at the rising rate of ruining the girls picture now this girl looks tough But would she be tough if she saw those eyes that we see looking at her from the top of the door I will run now this one. I can't relate to whenever I used to get scared Ace is just like put the blankets all around me and just like because my eyes I can still watch But like keep all of me covered It's the best safety measure when you're scared totally that or turning on the lights trail lights helps too You know what you look so good that your reflection stares back at you No, I don't either because that is just creepy this has to be photoshopped. There's no way. This is so scary. She's looking at us But it's looking this edition of reflection is look at her. What's going on guys I? Don't like this Next video.

but it's scary so you climb up a hundred and 30-foot high platform okay and here's the kicker you have to jump down onto the net without a harness or being strapped in or nothing what have you miss the net there's no way I wouldn't miss the net I'm a Z this is why I don't do this we're gonna watch a video of this because why not oh that is so high girl no no this is terrifying can't you got this you got this oh my god how how is he gonna drop her just  to drop herself Oh does that not hurt at all me me me me dude look carefully I gotta get me copyright claim this is what the ramp looks like just so you can get an idea what if it like it doesn't adjust properly on the track like a lineup that's terrifying Oh actually shivers I'm not down for this one anymore this person brought a loose bolt on the roller-coaster to scare his friend look at his face really Wow Wow and then they go off he's like are we gonna be okay this is just plain evil this one is insane it drops more than 90 degrees and like rolls back on itself I love how it like gives you a second before drops to think about all your life choices like why am I here Wow okay I felt that in my toes guys I felt that in my toes like my tummy everywhere I felt it do you guys feel it too even though you're not on it this guy just has his phone in his hands I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to have your phone in your hands but sure I mean how else would we get these wonderful videos something's gonna go wrong I feel it wait we need to watch it in slow-mo we need to watch out in slow-mo did you guys see what happened Spode meet face and what's so fast I just just barely missed it barely but I got it and this is why they tell you to not bring your phones with you on rollercoasters Oh funny story actually once on a roller coaster we were going and then I just saw this dudes flip flop like flying over my head but because you're going so fast it almost feels like it's like falling in slow motion it was kind of cool but I was thinking that flip flop hit my face imma be mad it didn't but it could have this is a roller coaster in Japan we all know Japan makes things extra cool so there's roller coasters probably gonna be extra cool right that's how logic works I like the colours and this versus cameras on point like look how blue the sky is oh we're going up guys we're going up okay did I hate that when you go up I'm like guess I guess that's good this is spin she's killing me oh my god let's pretend we're actually doing this put your hands in the air are they gonna drop us scared but the sky is blue look how pretty that is okay okay okay I'm not actually on a roller coaster so I need to chill oh oh whoa okay that spin was intense that's fun but I'm not gonna watch that again because I don't want anybody to get nauseous and throw up so this roller coaster actually he's not open yet so I'm giving you guys some early access so I'd say this probably will take the top for the scariest roller coaster ever like look at this thing like where where are you even going where's it taking me and can we go it's a little scary but I'm down it's like my emotions that was a deep this drop actually if you could see it goes like this we're gonna see a video of this I forgot to mention this is actually located in Japan how steep is oh that's a pretty view I like mountains oh okay the moment where the drop is so scary I'm not even on and I'm scared come on okay yes it literally goes in on it so what oh I don't know I don't know if I could do that I don't know if I could do that I don't know if I could do that why am I so scared I've been there I'm good guys I'm good I'm kuchi this roller coaster in Japan carries you upside down as if roller coasters weren't extreme enough as it is this is the x-scream in Las Vegas so this is base on scaring the heck out of you it's not for the faint of heart basically what it does it gets super close to the edge it makes it seem like you're gonna fall off kind of scares you big tilts back and forth gives you that illusion of death you know the love it okay let's see let's see let's see oh wow wait is it like not attached it better be attached okay oh it like goes back and forth look at that drop two guys I don't know I feel like watching roller coasters is scary than even being on them sometimes I'm scared for these people this is the sky ride in Germany so this ride actually allows you to control how many barrel rolls you want to do you just click a button do barrel roll however there was a big problem with this ride after testing it they actually found that it had way too much g-force on people's bodies and caused internal organ damage from too much force I actually didn't even make that up it's a fact needless to say the ride is now shut down for a good reason we need our organs this is a ride in New Zealand okay let's see this thing it kind of it looks cool you're like in a little container I guess okay let's let's do this let's do this lady press the button what is she physically moving us she's pushing it I've never seen a person what that was super dangerous she just jumped over that wait hold on a second something's not right here you see pedaling this ain't no ride this is an exercise machine you're not tricking me I mean it looks kind of fun fine fine I'll try it this is Skycycle probably one of the world's most eco-friendly roller coasters oh really roller coaster you're pedaling another pedal powered one in my opinion this might be the scariest one yet because look how high they are and they don't really look strapped in to me could be wrong but according to as these eyes they are not strapped in that ruins it from here I need to be strapped in at all times not careful enough for this type of stuff anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this video I love you guys so much stay awesome stay sweet and don't forget to be nice other [Music] [Music]", "channel_id":

No can you not dude this is giving me anxiety like this is necessary it is not necessary also how do you like evenly pour like that is this a trick I mean though there's a trick nobody's to try ever great so now you have to unstick them I guess no no no he's not he's gonna pour it into the little glasses like this huh oh wow Wow okay I'm impressed how do you line those up perfectly this must've took him so much time no yes okay that was impressive but also stressed me out because I thought he was gonna break everything spill everything you know airplane coming in for the landing and oh no your suntan could have gone real bad like and I'm not talking about a burn I was gonna say I feel like as the guys fought because he was behind the fence but that's not word the landing the landings on in front of the fence so he was like I think in the right area I mean I'm never gonna be that close like I'm never gonna be that close to a plane landing strip son tani because this could happen oh that's electricity this guy almost got Thunderbolt it like Pikachu almost came out to play that that would have been shocking to say the least dude what are you trying like first of all there's water second of all there's a bear like can you not oh no that bear is like you look delicious I don't actually know if there's a humans they probably don't he's looking at him like that okay there's absolutely no reason that you should ever climb a fence at a zoo to hang out the animals like I know they look you but most of the time they don't want to play nice at least so let's let's just you know not like this guy I'm actually so stressed out for this guy and for the bear how are these people filming allowing it it's called the bystander we're gonna chilling there chilling not going wrong yet hold on it's going run dude run to get out of there see this is why you don't climb fences instant regret I made the avoided disaster but he bear barely made it either get it cuz that was a bear I would have winnie-the-pooh to my pants I almost brushed my teeth with this on accident athlete's foot meant for your feet on your teeth it wouldn't have cleaned your teeth and it probably would have not been great oh no this person avoided disaster not just for themselves but for this little dude over here okay can you imagine accidentally drinking this dude he's alive I'm not okay with it kind of weird-looking you know like I just want him to go enjoy his life not in my stomach thank you yeah thank you this girl went to go buy a burrito for lunch and got charged forty nine thousand dollars I don't know this is true but she did not avoid disaster but also it was probably the most precious burrito effort like can you imagine how good a fifty thousand dollar burrito tastes cuz I can't I also would never spend that much money in a burrito how does this even happen I almost killed my family this morning making pancakes oh no my name is butter-flavored cooking spray and the other one is lemon scented furniture polish but they look exactly the same and it's by the same company you wouldn't think to change it up for such different products and the worst part about this is it kind of looks like it's like it has pictures two lemons like I'm like is it food it kind of looks like food not drinking water what do you mean these aren't fountains I've been drinking from these from years oh no oh wow okay I was like is that an animal I can't even tell what type of animal it is it was a cat or dog because it blends in so well with the rug it's something just fell in the balcony there's something just fell in the balcony I'm ceiling I don't know it's just like a little business card but I saw it like fall from the sky sorry I really want to see what it is it's somebody try to communicate with us by the way we're in Vegas right now and look at my setup like philomene on actually this animal it's exactly this rug and at this point I would just get a different color drug this thermometer is for their dogs but and it's a good thing they check before they put it in their mouth oh okay this one is probably the worst one like you avoided disaster 100% it really came to our room to get their card that was it oh no could've lost an arm honestly though like you think he could have lost an arm but I'm just like their shark just trying to get a good photo for the gram okay he's like make sure you put a filter onto them thanks me look good I was like what's the word I'm looking for you know most parking garages and by most I mean all of them have ramps well the ones that have multiple floors at least I don't think you need to take the stairs with your car that's usually for human purposes only Wow how'd you get out of this pickle there okay but the car I don't know put the car these pilots crashed into a ferris wheel and somehow no one got hurt but they're still stuck no big deal this girl was parasailing and avoided disaster now maybe not because you know sharks can be really friendly they're not as like mean as people think they are but if they think you food then you food like you're not winning I've swam with sharks before when I went scuba diving and you know they were cheered they're cool they're pretty they're like there's like scary a little bit but they don't didn't do anything I feel like sharks got a pretty bad rep but doesn't mean I'm not scared of them like I'm never gonna mess with a hungry shark now this video has had some pretty crazy things but this I have to look away I can't look he fell asleep and dropped his pants up not the pizza imagine driving and then seen a landslide right in front of you cover the road wow this is terrifying luckily no one got hurt except for the roads they got hurt but it's okay you know you can rebuild roads oh no this is cement honestly this guy did not avoid disaster I mean he could have done hurt but that car cars ruined that cement has quick-dry it all over and nothing's getting it off of all the places you could have parked I would say you got pretty lucky dude like I think this deserves a round of applause hey I parked one spot over just one spot over trial car ruined now he

If you don't know what Twitch is It's a platform where you live stream, so everything's happening live. So if you screw up or do something embarrassing the Internet will keep it FOREVER So what's gonna happen? We're zooming into something intense, it's gonna happen PFFFFFT HA HA HA HA HA *GASP* NOOOO How does that even happen like, imagine my chair just like SHBAM That's what I mean something: embarrassing happens to you on a stream. It stays on the Internet FOREVER So this is guy shopping in a store. Okay, he's checking out yo thank you for the sub uhhh thisarobbery This a robbery? Oh no, that's so awkward. So on Twitch as well when people subscribe or when they donate like their name pops up So this person's name is thisarobbry and this dude is shopping and everybody around him now thinks that he's gonna rob Okay what's gonna GASP SPEAKING OF ROBBERIES This dude just ran up to some dude's streaming  and stole his phone. Wow. Out of all the phones you could have stolen You stole the one dude who was live on Twitch. Well, guess what? Now thousands of people have seen your face and now thousands of people know You're a thief and now thousands of people are gonna report you to the police. You're gonna be really easy to find I'm not saying you should ever a rob but like come on so stupid it's bad enough already as it is You're a thief but you're also stupid Okay Girls walking just going for a stroll I'm I was that way like what's gonna happ- A pole happened. A POLE. I mean, I can't even make fun of her that much because I I did see it, I did see it. We all saw it. I can't make fun of her too much because I do that all the time I'm never paying attention and then I walk into poles. At least she says she's been drinking. I have no excuse So this girl thinks she's getting into her uber. The guy thinks he's picking up a girl... if you know what I mean It's just she's getting in the front cuz the back doors locked because he does he's not an uber driver. He's picking up... \"a girl\" So he wants her to turn it off because what he's doing is illegal And she wants to keep it on because she just thinks she's getting an uber driver So she's like, \"What?!\" But I guess if like you own a car and you're Ubering people you have the right to tell you and left to film Right. Do you? It's your car. I don't know what the rules are It's not recording don't worry it's not recording It's not recording or anything, just thousands and thousands and thousands maybe millions and millions of people are watching. Who knows? I mean, I don't know how many times this video got shared but a lot of people have seen this Yeah, just talking to my friends, you know just 1, 2... million people ooo this... This is terrifying. Like this is why when you order an uber you always gotta check the app and make sure the license plate matches the license plate Of the car you get into Hello? You're looking for Caroline, right? From Washington DC I live here Oh my gosh, she's scared now because the person who just called (hello?) was the uber driver She was supposed to get into the car with and they uber drivers like hey, where are you? My heart would be racing at this point. She thinks she's getting kidnapped. He's not trying to kidnap her to be fair, buuuuuuuuuuuut Still. Are you an uber? No. Oh my God. Drop me off. Oh my God Okay, thank you Misunderstanding?!! That is terrifying So this is streaming. Okay and his mom walks in behind him while he's streaming and she's in her underwear Hella awkward. I don't know what's more awkward, for him or his mom. Either way, it sucks This is why I don't stream, like you never know what's gonna happen. This next one is a messed-up story, Okay? You see this dude, looks fairly nice, right? He is supposedly disabled. Okay until Until he just walks off With his feet! Like a miracle just happened. Yeah, you saw that. So what he was doing is he's pretending to be disabled So he could get donations. Isn't that really horrible of someone to do? Like you should never fake something to get something because what did that thing actually ever happens? You don't know how this universe works how horrible you're gonna feel then like the people who like pretend Someone's died so they can call in sick It's like how are you gonna feel if that person actually dies? Horrible Right?\nLike you never ever ever want to make up something Negative just to get something positive because what goes around comes around, people. I guess he forgot his webcam was on I don't know what happened But dude, you stood up one way some way some day lies always come out and this is proof This one is insane So this dude is playing with matches on stream, which I think you should just never play with matches ever But I mean, I guess like what if you want to light a candle? I don't know but this goes horribly wrong So wrong, that this dude throws the lit match into the garbage behind him aaaand Then the garbage like on fire and then sets his whole house on fire He lives with other people. Luckily everyone got out it safe Nobody was injured but this dude just burned his house down live on stream I've heard of crazy things happening stream, but this takes the cake I don't understand what he's doing. Is he trying to make a bigger fire? You know, just add some cardboard to it Let's just give fuel to the fire like you are making it worse Yeah, flammable things. Put flammable things on top of the fire. That's gonna help. Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhh. I don't I feel like it just this is just common sense Would you put paper on top of fire to take out the fire? No, you would probably put like a wet towel on top of a fire or water I don't know, anything but paper and cardboard is what I'm saying? Oh wait Oh, he's finally coming in the water after he's made it massive I feel like a wet towels at best scenario but at this point like this point you just gotta call 9-1-1 like you gotta call 9-1-1 get the Firefighters in there to do this job because dude, you don't know what you're doing. I'm terrified Okay, so this dude's just playing games and Oh Mic attack I mean, I can't say I've never done that this pink mic has hit me in the face more times than I can count But at least it got it got a little soft stuff on it So like doesn't hurt his looks like his looks like it would hurt. Like you could lose a tooth with that thing she's just taking out a door on stream Ohhhh I like saw that happen before it happened. Oh, I want some of that food , I want some of that Her reaction Was so adorable she was like That was so cute I just wanted to hug her after but also I hope she's okay, and there was no broken glass. So this girl thought her stream was off She started acting pretty weird. UHH OMAGAHH BLUGGH OOOH Like I'm sure we're all weird on our own time But yeah I guess I guess you gotta be a little extra careful when you're a streamer, and by a little I mean a lot more careful So this girl's streaming in public at a bar ok, ok cheers cheers *mouth drop* ha everyone went quiet No one's gonna help her up? Come on people help the girl up! I'm glad this guy eventually went but first he enjoyed the show. He was like, (welp. nvmd). But THAT was a bad fall She like took the chair with her and everything. Okay, so they're driving and streaming which Honestly Wowwww I was just gonna say is very irresponsible and this is why I really don't think you should be filming, Texting, doing anything that distracts you from the road when you're driving because you don't realize how powerful a car is I understand you might think you're the best driver in the world But you don't know how other people drive and also, how horrible would you feel if you hurt someone? It's not good There's a lot of people who love you too like you don't wanna do anything While you're in the car except for drive that distracts you from driving How many times I need to say this? At least like ten more times? Like people need to just stop doing it. Anyways, guys. I hope you enjoyed this video. I love you all so MUUUCHH Stay awesome.

travel possible the experts say no but what do they know fueled by Hollywood and overly active imaginations there's more than a few of us that either believe or want to believe that one day we could travel to another place in time in fact some people say there's a mountain of photographic evidence to prove the existence of time travelers from other place people and objects to celebrity doppelganger from the past are these evidence of time travelers or just overactive imaginations the hipster this is the picture that started it all taken in British Columbia Canada in the 1940s some think the tall sunglass wearing man is clearly a time traveler after all he stands out like a sore thumb in the crowd thanks to his clothing his camera and yes those sunglasses experts say that everything this guy is wearing is period-appropriate so the question that remains is have we found a true time traveler or just an original hipster Michael Cera what better way to hide the fact that you are a time traveler than to act all awkward and aloof while holding a career as an actor well Michael Cera you've just been busted this picture taken in 1930s Germany suggests some pretty big things first the Canadian actor travelled back in time as a spy to infiltrate the Nazi organization or Michael Cera is actually a time traveler from the past set forward in time to infiltrate Hollywood just think of him as the Terminator only not so scary and murderous the factory worker in 2013 footage emerged taken at a DuPont Factory in Massachusetts in the 1930s which seemingly seemed out of place the short video showed workers exiting the plant and one of them talking into what appeared to be a cell phone how can this be explained there were no cell towers at this time and radio communications still require large bulky sets some have said it's a hearing aid this is plausible except no one seems to be talking to her while she is the one talking into the device JZ Shawn Carter was born in Brooklyn New York and has gone on to become a superstar rapper and producer better known as jay-z this is a picture taken in the Bronx in 1933 which has captured the image of a man who looks more than a little like the superstar just a doppelganger or evidence of time travel the Bronx and Brooklyn are only a 30 minute drive apart and jay-z's first album was called reasonable doubt you make the call Jennifer Lawrence we're not done with potential time-traveling celebrities yet thanks to x-men The Hunger Games and silver linings playbook actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the actress in Hollywood for the past five years but what about before that well if you're into time travel then she was Egyptian actress who beta for what we hypothesized at tharwat looking to break into American cinema changed her name to the more common Jennifer the last name well that's easy who's a famous Westerner to have spent a great deal of time in Egypt Lawrence of Arabia San Jose Bay traveler in 1917 someone snapped a picture of people relaxing along the shoreline of San Jose everything looks normal except for one guy who doesn't quite blend in the shaggy-haired man has been dubbed surfer dude by some people and cited as proof that time travel does exist the reactions of the men on either side and the lady to the right who was pointing are said to be further proof this guy does not a Photoshop job just a guy who was stripped down to his underwear no one is a hundred percent sure Vladimir Putin he rides horses shirtless hunts Tigers and finds ancient treasure yes we are talking about Russian leader Vladimir Putin if these pictures are anything to go by then he potentially possesses the power of time travel while some have argued he is immortal similar to a Russian version of the Captain America time travel believers aren't so sure instead they think Putin has used his time travel ability to show up in some of the bumpiest periods of Russia's history to help alter the course of history the Gettysburg traveler I think the government has been experimenting successfully with time travel for decades then we'd like to introduce you to Andrew basiago this lawyer claims that as a child he was subjected to government experiments as part of project Pegasus that saw him traveled back in time two periods which included Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in 1863 the proof but she also claims he is the child pictured in the center of this photograph taken at Gettysburg he also claims he was at Ford's Theater and that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated Greek laptop we know that ancient Greece was a civilization which was very advanced for its time but so advanced as to have access to modern computers this ancient Greek statue has definitely raised some eyebrows and has time travel advocates excited experts think the statue shows a woman opening a tablet or box skeptics like to point out the two holes on the side of the laptop which they say represent power or USB ports it all seems a bit odd considering there would be no way to charge the laptop and no Wi-Fi service for the ancient Greeks to keep up on the latest celebrity gossip Charlie Chaplin time traveler can you hear me now this video has perplex people since it became available several years ago an extra piece of footage from Charlie Chaplin's 1928 film the circus appears to show a woman talking on a cell phone skeptics argue that the woman is merely using a deer trumpet or some other hearing aid which was widely available at the time others think the woman is actually a

cake with black text icing his co-workers may have been sad to see him go but we imagine the cake helped them get over it a bit quicker we thank you for flying steven Slater had served 20 years in the airline business and we're guessing this ex-flight attendant had finally had enough of the pre-flight speeches and pushy customers having just finished a flight from Pittsburgh to JFK Slater decided to quit in a dramatic fashion the JetBlue employee grabbed the intercom berated rude passengers and then grabbed a beer and slid down the emergency shoot to unemployment his stunt got headlines everywhere but resulted in a $10,000 fine and one year of probation telling it as it is in 2012 Greg Smith had finally had enough of his job and decided to quit smith an executive director at Goldman Sachs had joined the company fresh out of school however as his resignation letter posted in the New York Times put it the company had become toxic smith's letter is quite damning and highlights the various reasons he needed to quit from trying to sell clients a product they don't need to referring to your customers as muppets Smith couldn't take it anymore and decided to share his final thoughts on the matter very publicly what I really think if you've watched enough news then you know that every news network has their own agenda or political angles liz Wall found this out while working for Russia Today a news network funded by the Russian government which presents stories in a strongly pro-Russian light in 2014 Wall decided she had had enough of the way Russia Today was reporting on events in Ukraine while on the air she voiced her concerns and announced that she was quitting dance it all away as a video producer for a Taiwanese animation firm Marina Shiffron had become disillusioned with her job looking to end her role in the business Shiffron decided to produce one last video which ended up going viral the resignation video showed the 25-year-old dancing around the office to Kanye West's gone meanwhile in on-screen text Shiffron explained she was quitting because her boss only cared about quantity and the job was taking up too much of her time the resignation turned a lot of heads including Queen Latifah who offered her a role on her own talk show with a little style Phil Sipka didn't hate his job as a barista in Chicago but it was time for something else rather than just quit like most of us he decided to go out in style with help from the Steve Harvey Show he presented his resignation with a barbershop quartet backing him up people criticized the whole thing as being fake but it turns out it was staged to a degree as Cypusa's co-workers knew he was coming in to quit they just didn't realize his resignation would be delivered in such a manner a beat we can march to some people want something really over the top when they quit with all the bells and the whistles joey D franchesco decided to make that dream a reality tired of working at a hotel in Rhode Island the 23-year-old decided to quit in a way he had always wanted backed up by a marching band with the whole thing on video D franchesco is shown handing in his resignation to a former boss before marching out to the music of a brass band a massive audience imagine telling your boss that you were quitting in front of 100 million people gwen Dean did just that the machine engineer of 18 years was tired of her job and wanted to pursue her dream of puppetry she teamed up with GoDaddy and during a commercial which aired during the Super Bowl Gwen let her boss know she was done we can only imagine what her boss and co-workers thought when they first saw her on television and then second delivering notice that she was leaving in a very public way strange but epic if delivering your resignation backed by a band isn't enough how about doing it all while dressed up one unnamed man posted a rather humorous video of himself quitting from an insurance company dressed as a banana while the choice of costume and the quality of video are questionable we think the mariachi band gave the whole thing a fun and festive feel it also struck a note with every person around the world who hated their job and dreamed of quitting in such an over-the-top manner thanks for watching our video folks let us know what you thought of all these epic quitting scenarios down below in

to share with you guys now before we get started with that and get right into this video I actually want to let you guys know I'm doing a $1,000 giveaway for you guys my active homies and subscribers and I'm talking about people that are liking my videos every day that are subscribed commenting up to 10 to 15 random comments about the video every single video and I'm doing this mainly because we just hit 1.8 million subscribers and I want to give back you guys as much as possible all you need to do to enter in this giveaway is like the video make sure you're subscribed and comment 15 random comments simple as that but more importantly make sure that like button is blue before you leave because that's how you guys mainly enter in this giveaway but what's up guys like I said today I have something very very creepy to share with you guys actually very weird and I wanted to talk about this for a few days now but I've just been so busy with moving into my new house that I really haven't had time to put together something like this and actually talk about this I've had other videos planned so that's why I'm doing this video today there is something very scary and creepy going on in GTA 5 that I thought I would let you guys know about because apparently you guys shouldn't play GTA 5 at 3:00 a.m. weird right I I was like kind of confused at first when I heard about this apparently there's some [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on in GTA that you don't want to witness and a lot of people are telling me not to sign into GTA 5 at 3:00 a.m. not to do it and I wanted to know why why what would the what was the main reason behind this I was a little bit confused at first so I do a little bit of a research on this and I'm looking around and I come to find out that there's something very scary going on in the tunnels at 300 a.m. and when I say 3:00 a.m. guys I mean 3:00 a.m. in game now I haven't played GTA 5 within the past I would say week I've just been so busy with other stuff right now I'm moving into a new place and I'm actually in that place right now but I'm moving furniture in so I've just been really busy and I haven't had time to actually play GTA 5 but apparently there's a lot of players that are going in the tunnels and saying it's very spooky and super super creepy at 3:00 a.m. if you guys don't know about the sewers in GTA 5 a lot of people are already suspected that the sewers are either haunted or there's some type of monster known as rapman that lives in the sewers that no one has ever seen before but there are a few leaked images apparently and it's scary you know that the myth of rapman is just a little weird okay and there's ghost in the game already that makes makes GTA 5 a bit spooky but apparently there are players going down in the sewers of Los Santos at 3:00 a.m. and experiencing some very very scary paranormal kind of kind of things going on and I mean I mean weird sounds um not only is there banging down there but people are hearing a lot of footsteps running like I'm talking about like speed running it's known that rapman has a tendency of being very very fast being able to run at 100 miles an hour plus you know I'm talking about really really fast which is very scary to even think about that's that's just spooky in itself so players are legit going in the sewers and just testing this out I mean players all around dude like players all over are going in the sewers whether that's in GTA 5 online or single player around 3:00 a.m. and exploring the sewers in itself and literally just exploring the whole entire thing trying to find out what this is where it's coming from who it is if it's ratman if it's maybe a ghost maybe they have ghost down there I don't know I'm honestly a little lost people are starting to even come to conclusions that maybe just maybe aliens have something to do with this I mean the fact that there are UFOs in Grand Theft Auto already aliens in Grand Theft Auto I would think maybe I could definitely agree that this could possibly be an alien maybe maybe layer a lot of people have been saying maybe there's aliens hidden in the tunnels in the sewers like there's tunnels within the walls of the sewers and maybe that could be the case I want to know from you guys though Down Below in the comments what do you guys think this is because I'm super curious to find out what you guys think about this honestly I think this is just something to do with the Easter egg of ratman maybe or maybe some type of Easter egg down in the in the sewers maybe that has to do with like some type of aliens I have no clue it's really interesting to see these type of things these type of Easter eggs come about because a a lot of more people come together and get interested with this like the community comes together and they try to you know crack this they try to find a way to find out what this Easter egg is and finish the Easter egg and and maybe maybe just maybe this is Morse code I've been hearing that as well from a lot of you guys in the comment section and as well over on Twitter that this could possibly be some type of Morse code maybe trying to tell you something or maybe Morse code to a certain location in Los Santos which I'm not even sure dude you know like I said this is just really really creepy but I want to know from you guys legit I want everyone to comment down below what you guys think about this and I want to see all your thoughts and you know what if you guys comment I will reply to a few of you guys I promise and more importantly before you do leave make sure you guys make sure that like button is blue before you leave so you enter in the giveaway that I'm doing I want to give back to as many of you awesome mother lovers as possible so make sure you guys are subscribed to my YouTube channel and liking all my videos as always and I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart you guys are amazing dude like the support you've been overall showing on this channel has been just tremendous like absolutely insane and I want to thank each and every one of you guys for just being awesome and always showing support you guys are absolutely amazing but anyways I love you love you love you you awesome mother lovers take care and I'll see you in the next one this is going to be part two of the search of ratman guys what's going on letby Jimmy here and today we are going to be searching for the one the only [\u00a0__\u00a0] rapman dude and honestly I was questioning if I wanted to do this just because the first time it was it was a little sketchy dude it was just a little sketchy but you know what you guys have requested to keep searching for this guy and if you don't know what rapman looks like okay I don't even know if it's a guy but apparently this is what he's supposed to look like only a few people in the community have came across this guy and apparently he runs super fast okay he's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] Sprinter okay so a little nerve-wracking dude I am going to panic if I see this [\u00a0__\u00a0] and also I want to let you guys know people have reported footsteps of uh ratman following them so we're also going to check that out as well cuz we haven't explored the whole entire sewers at least not yet I haven't explored the whole sewers with you guys so uh thank you Jacob for the like thank you Noah for the like Stephen thank you for the like I appreciate it I could already see people saying Jimmy you know what about this area dude I have no idea what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is in this area dude all I know is that all I know is that we can't get over there all right so listen I'm going to I'm going to turn up the volume hella guys all right I don't want it to be too loud for you guys but I want to make sure you're able to hear as much as I'm able to hear okay I know it's a wet place there's rats everywhere anyways but it's been a place that a lot of people have been like trying to figure out what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] down here cuz Believe it or or not guys I mean believe it or not the sewers itself is a pretty [\u00a0__\u00a0] scary place dude is a pretty scary place and you know what's weird as well that I've noticed is there's only no more than two like workers down here there's either one worker well I'll show you guys where the workers are but there's no more ever than two workers down in this area so maybe that has something to do with ratman but I don't know maybe maybe this stream we could get this [\u00a0__\u00a0] on stream [\u00a0__\u00a0] we could see him because apparently rapman does Random Encounters with people guys Random Encounters it's just random he'll run by you pretty quick hold on all right so that's just like a a step area does that lead out to anywhere no can I shoot that light no okay so nothing you can do all right so one of the co-workers should be working down here right now let's see hold on guys let me make sure that the sound effects are all the way up I don't want it to be too loud for your guys's ear but I also don't want it to be too low I want you guys to be able to hear me loud and clear and also the sorry about that loud ass badding Bing AO everyone comment bding in the chat I'm always getting nervous down here guys so if you ever see me getting nervous [\u00a0__\u00a0] off mate all right your boy's a your boy's a nervous wreck all right I'm gay I'm I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] gay all right guys here we go now now I want to point out one thing real quick to all you guys watching I have noticed this and I think a few people have as well I've seen this in the comments this light right here is green believe it or not this light is green guys this light is green so I don't know if this has anything to do with aliens okay I'm just pointing that out there right now we don't hear the banging yet actually we don't hear any banging yet guys no banging yet but then you'll come to the same exact let's kill that rat we'll come we come to the same exact area it has the same exact like uh Roofing as you guys just saw back there with the green light right look at this same area different light you know it's a regular light so that green light is not normal okay just pointing that out there right off the bat green light # notnormal buddy that [\u00a0__\u00a0] ain't [\u00a0__\u00a0] normal so I want to know what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] that means as well I mean dude there's a lot of hints we got Morse code hints and [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that oh man", "channel_id": "UCgrA08uO7JR9h6Xr-ONjPkA", "channel_name":

interesting these videos would be for you guys to watch it didn't even cross my mind to think that i could be banned for life on fortnite from from those videos i just want to be clear this is my first time i've ever done anything like this and of course i have never done this in a competitive game mode at all you know at the time i posted those videos i was completely oblivious to what could happen to me like what the consequences were obviously this was a huge mistake and it's completely wrong on my end you know i really don't know what to be like generally i don't even know what i was thinking like cheating in anything is just terrible you should never do it it's not acceptable it's zero tolerance you should it's just it's just such a dumb thing to do i should have paid more attention to the community rules and the tos of fortnite and like yeah i just want to urge you guys all to review all of those terms and services and stuff so that nothing like this could ever happen to you because oh it's it's it's actually so [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah i genuinely don't know what to say like this just just knowing that i can never play fortnite again or like or even like create oh you know it's crazy that i i'm i can never play fortnite again or even create content for you guys you know it's obvious that i made a massive mistake and of course i would never think about doing anything like this again you know when i was making those videos i never thought about the consequence and i never thought about the consequences that could happen from me making those videos i just thought about i just thought about entertaining you guys you know the amount of happiness i get from playing fortnite every day is crazy like just waking up being able to play the game it's just so much fun and now now i i can't i can't play fortnite at all i've been permanently banned like you know i i know how much you guys all love fortnite and how much you love watching me play fortnite you know it's crazy how one game can genuinely just change your life forever and it's just allowed me to become a regular part of your lives where you you get home from school or work or whatever and you just watch my videos like it's truly amazing to me this also makes me so sad because i just know now that i can never go to any other events or like even be a part of the fortnite community just like the amount of offer obviously this is going to prevent me from going to any other events or even exploring other opportunities and especially meeting you guys at these tournaments you know it's just it's so crazy you know i love this game so much i'm still gonna love this it's so hard oh you know i'm still gonna love this game no matter what happens like i just wish i could have known how badly i was messing up because i would never have ever thought of even making those kind of videos if i knew that this could have actually happened i know now how big of a mistake this was and like i it's just there's nothing i can epic games you know i i know of how big of a mistake i made i liked i'm truly like so sorry epic i know i have to take accountability for my actions and you know i'm gonna i'm gonna do my best to accept any punishment and like comes my way whatever happens i'm not trying to find like a quick road out but like being banned forever it's just i think i'm a lifetime bat it's just oh i just didn't i i didn't expect this what happened especially from a game you know that i love so much like i've never made a video like this and you know i never thought never thought i would have to oh i can't i can't speak you know all i ever wanted is just like a chance to be able to play fortnite again like that's all i want to do is just play fortnite i you know i just want to do what i truly love the most in life and it's just impossible and i have no idea what i'm gonna do next but just know i'm not gonna go anywhere like what whatever happens i'm gonna carry on making content for you guys of course like i love you guys so much i appreciate like all the support you guys have shown me over the last two years like it's just so like just crazy how much love you guys have shown towards me and like i'm so disappointed in myself for doing this and not thinking about like the consequences that could have happened no i just wish i could go back in time and just change all of this to make it never happen yeah i'm just like i'm sorry to everybody watching this video i don't really know what else to say like i love you he like you guys generally don't understand how much each and every one of you mean to me yeah that's uh that's the end of the video guys this is this is this is it um i'll see you in my next one i i don't know i don't know i don't know",

I have 10 challenges,\nand we have 10 people! And the last one of you to\nleave this island keeps it! (everyone cheers) So, let's just jump right\ninto the first challenge. - Oh my God. - The last one to put a\ncoconut in this hole leaves. Bye. Go. (everyone shouts) - Oh! - Yes! - Buddy, no. Oh, you're very sweaty. - My whole family is gonna\nbe so disappointed in me. - I didn't have time to get\nanything through my mind. - I got so lucky. Tyler grabbed the one I was going for, and there was one more\nright behind the rock. That wasn't there, I'm out. - Jed, I'm sorry, but you\nlost the first challenge, so you must leave the island. - I'll miss you, bro. - It literally could've been anybody. That's so true. - [Man] Do a flip! - And there goes our first contestant. By the end of this video,\nonly one person will remain. I feel bad for the man,\nbut the show goes on. I got an island to give away. For the second challenge,\nyou're gonna vote someone off. Everybody write a name on that clipboard. Whoever has the most votes is leaving. This is about to be really intense. So, everyone's stuff is written down. Everyone give me all your pens. There we go. Now they cannot change what\nthey have written down. The votes have been added up,\nand we have a clear cut loser. Tyler, you're safe. - Oh my God.\n- All right, good job. - And between you two... - Yeah. - I'm bad at this. I'm really bad at- - Spit it out. - Darren, you lost. Tyler, Tyler, you're- - I'm in? - That's crazy, bro. - I wonder where Darren, how he feels. He's over there standing. He don't know what to do. (MrBeast sighs) - It's painful. Just so you all know, the person about to walk in front of you, the person about to lose\nthis island, you voted off. - It was all Karl's fault. - It was all Karl. - All right, Darren, walk down the pier. - Sorry, bro. This is bad. - [MrBeast] Oh my gosh. - I saw that. - I love you. Thanks for coming out. - Thank you. (buzzer buzzes) - I feel so bad. But the show must go on. Before we do the next challenge, I just wanna see how you\nguys are doing and feeling. - Anxious.\n- I wanna die. - I feel betrayed. - Highly paranoid. - If I win, I'm gonna sell this island. I don't want it. (everyone laughs) - Karl, here's a camera. Tyler, here's a camera. Now you all have a camera. For this next challenge, we\nare playing hide and seek. - No!\n- No, please, no! - [MrBeast] You can go hide. (everyone shouts) - I'm running. - And now all eight of them are hiding. One, two, three. - Yo, I gotta find a tree to climb. - Find something quick. - I swear, every noise I hear, I feel like I'm about to get caught. - I've lost so much\nmoney on hide and seek. Maybe I'll climb on that tree. - [MrBeast] 89, 90, 91, 92. (MrBeast sneezes) - I gotta fart. \u266a Hiding and seeking \u266a \u266a But I'm just hiding \u266a - Imagine if you lost an entire\nisland because of a fart. - 296, 297, 298, 299, 300. Ready or not here I come! Whoever I find doesn't\nget a private island. The beauty of this is I don't have to find all eight of them. I only have to find one. I bet a lot of them hid in these bushes. I see you! That was a joke. But if someone is over there, they're pooping their pants now. - Did they go past me? - No one over here. Chandler, I have food! I have a feeling I'll never find anyone. Birds usually make noise\nwhen they see people, and they're making noise right there. I'm onto something. Oh! Tyler! - No! - [MrBeast] Oh my gosh. Wait, did you see me\nwalking up that whole time? - Yes! - I found him! - I just lost an island\n'cause I laid here? - So, Tyler, you lost\n$50,000 in hide and seek. - Yep. - 60,000. - Yep. - 70,000. And now 700,000. You've lost a million dollars\nto just hide and seek, Tyler. Congratulations! I didn't find any of you. The person I found was Tyler. - [Chris] Woo! Yeah! - All those people are now\ngonna compete for the island. I want you to walk past\nthem towards the boat. - It was an honor buddy. - Can I get one? Tyler, let me get one? - Bye, Tyler! Glad it was you, not me! - [Karl] Tyler! - [MrBeast] You missed,\nthe boat's right there. This next challenge\nwill be a swimming one. - Yeah!\n- Yeah! - I need you all to turn\naround and face the beach. And then on my signal, turn\naround and swim to the boat. Last to touch it is out. But I'm gonna put it further away. This next challenge is very physical. It's easily the hardest\nthing we've done so far. One of them is about to\nlose that entire island. Three, two, one, go! All right, Tyler's in 1st. Ethan's in 2nd. Jess is getting left in the dust. Come on! Come on! All right, Tyler's 1st. Ethan is 2nd. Karl is 3rd. Chris is 4th. Chandler has an interesting\nstrategy, but he's 5th. Nolan. And Jess came in last. - I can't believe I didn't lose. I really thought that was me. - I'm so out of shape. - I knew I was gonna probably lose 'cause I'm not really fast at swimming. - I'm so sorry, Jessie! - We love you. - [Karl] We love you! - So, do I make her get off\nthe boat and then get back on or do we just send the boat off? What do I do? I'm new to this, you know,\nisland game show type thing. It was a close race,\nbut Jess came in last, and we have to send her off. And I feel bad for making\nyou get off the boat just to get back on it. Boys, salute. - Bye! Chris, here you go. Ethan. Karl. You must be behind the line. And the only way to score\nis to put it in the circle. Land on the pad, I don't care. You're all gonna throw at the same time. - What? - Okay. Three, two, one, throw! - Yes! - Oh! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Mine went over the hole. It glazed over it. Maybe if it was even! - We did it. - Nothing is stopping me\nfrom selling this island the second I win it! - Congratulations on the win, boys. I'm proud of you guys. So, one of them is about to leave. - Thank God. - I'm letting you guys decide. - Chris, easy, easy. - You want Chris gone? - Absolutely. - Chris is a threat at the end of the day. He wins a lot. - [MrBeast] He does. - All right, Nolan. - [Nolan] I'm sorry. - Chris. - Yes. - You're out, I'm sorry. Honestly, I thought you\nwere gonna win the island. - I tried. I gave it my all, but, you know. - You gotta go get on the boat. - Nolan- - Come here. - I have no regrets. (everyone laughs) - Nolan! - I'll miss everyone except for Nolan! - Who was that guy? Who was he? Was he a contestant? - For this next challenge, I'll need you all to put on a blindfold. Blindfolds on. - How do you wear this? - Pull your blindfolds up. Look at this treasure chest. All right, put your blindfolds back on. I'm gonna go hide this on the beach. The first person to find it wins. Hey, can someone give me a shovel? I don't actually need a shovel. Timmy's our Tarzan. Just put it right there. And they don't know this, but whoever finds it first\ngets to pick who leaves next. It's about to get insanely intense. Oh man, my back hurts. Boom. They're gonna think this is it as well. First one of you to find\nthe treasure chest gets to pick who leaves next. - Oh, what? - Yes. Go! Find the treasure chest. - I'm so dizzy. - There's no chance. - Karl, what are you doing? You're just digging a random hole? - I just know that you think, you're gonna try to put\nit next to like a landmark of some sort. - Oh God. - Where the heck is it? - [Tyler] That would've been a play. - Oh no! Dude, is it in the water? (Chandler groans) - [Chandler] Ow! - Oh, snap! - Guys, keep looking. Where is it? - Bruh. - Where is it, guys? - It's in a tree? - I just don't know how\nhe found it so fast. Like, I'm sitting there\nlooking for it in the sand. - Karl, open up your treasure chest. Inside is a golden coconut. - Yeah! - Whoever you throw this\ngolden coconut at is out. Make your decision. - It's between you two,\nI'm gonna be honest. I'm just gonna say that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I love you. I appreciate it, buddy. - I picked the wrong choice. (everyone laughs) - This does not get\neasier the more I do it. Tyler. - Hey, it's been real. - You gotta walk down the pier of shame. - I love you, dude. - Oh really? So, you're not mad at\nhim for voting you off? - The beef isn't worth it, man. - Get out of here. - Nice knowing you. (buzzer buzzes) - [MrBeast] Oh, he is a little mad. Welcome to the final four! - Yeah! - Here's the thing. You four need to pick one\nof the people who have lost and bring them back. - Jessie. - I'm voting Jessie. - So, that's two Jess. - I am also gonna go Jessie. - Jessie. - I picked Jessie 'cause\nI think she was one of the only people that's out right now that didn't say they\nwanted to vote me out. - Chandler and Karl are tight. Me and Nathan just had a talk. We really gotta get Jessie on board or else we may have a problem. - There was three vote all Jessie, so really my vote didn't matter. - You guys voted for Jessie\nand now she's coming back! Jess, Jess, Jess! - I'm back! - Welcome back to the island, Jess. There's now five people. Let's go to the next challenge. Here's what we're doing\nfor the next challenge. We're gonna go person to\nperson to person to person to person and see if you're\nsubscribed to the channel. If you're not subscribed, you lose. I'm confident you're all subscribed. You're literally competing\nfor $700,000 on my channel. Like, how could you not be subscribed? All right, Karl. - Oh my God. - We're gonna search MrBeast. He is subscribed. He passed the test. Speaking of which you\nguys should subscribe because if you're ever competing for a million dollar island, I'd hate for you to lose\nbecause you're not, just saying. I'm going to open up YouTube. - Yes! - [MrBeast] He is subscribed. - No way, no way! - Oh my God! - Okay. - You are subscribed. - Woo! - He is subscribed. He is subscribed. You're the last person. Subscribed. You all were subscribed\nto the main channel. So logically now we check if you're subscribed\nto the gaming channel. Karl is subscribed to MrBeast Gaming. - With that bell pressed. - Oh.\n- Look at that. Nolan is not subscribed to MrBeast Gaming. (Nolan groans) But don't worry, Nolan. We have three more people to check. All right. Are you going to redeem Nolan? No. You're on our island. Search, MrBeast Gaming. He is subscribed. - Ring ring that bell. - All right, boys, pay attention. She is subscribed. She is subscribed. Everyone that is actually logical and subscribed to important\nchannels, step aside. - Gladly. - And now it's time for the\nmost important subscribe test of them all, Pewdiepie. Are you subscribed? I don't know, yes! Yes!\n- Subscribed. - Yes! Let's do it! If you're not subscribed,\nyou have to leave the island. - Oh my gosh. - Pewdiepie. He is not subscribed to Pewdiepie. Nolan, you continue to the next round. And Tags, I'm really bad\nat this, but you don't. - It wasn't even your channel. - Ethan, buddy. I'm sorry.\n- It was tragic. - You already know what I'm gonna say. The boat's there. - Hey bro, I've been in a spot like this. It gets better. You just keep losing over and over. - I'll keep this seat warm for you. Nolan, your next, bud. Bye y'all. - Bye. - You four are all that remains. I want you four to\nbreak into teams of two. I'm gonna let you decide. - I think a lot of people slept on Jessie but she's a winner, and we're\ngonna win this together. - This is my buddy. - And now there's four. Again, take your golden coconut. Take your golden coconut. Toss it to your partner. All right. Now, take a step back. Now you must throw it back. Whoever drops their coconut first loses. - You ready? - [Karl] Yes. Okay. - All right, they caught it. Take a step back. - If you need to... - All right, take a step back. - Oh, we're out next. - [Nolan] Let's go! - Now, we're getting pretty far away. Give it another toss. - Go. - [Jessie] Ready? - Oh! (Nolan yells) (Karl laughs) - Go. - Miss! (Jessie yells) Potato. - All right. Ooh, okay. - Easy!\n- That's all day. That's all day! - Oh! - I'm so nervous. - [Karl] I'm so nervous. - I have an intense feeling\nthat Karl's about to drop this. - Stop, stop, stop! - [MrBeast] You ready? - Don't drop it, don't drop it. - Yes! - All right. - I cannot pass this line. - I got you. - [MrBeast] Karl, throw that coconut. Oh! Oh! - That was so money! - Ready, Nolan? - [MrBeast] Oh, she threw it. - [Karl] Yes! - I'm so sorry. - You were close. - Boys, pick a number between one and two. - Two. - Two. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Oh no, wait. - Now we're gonna have a game of luck. I had Karl and Chandler pick\na number between one and two. Whichever one of you guesses it stays on. Whoever gets it wrong leaves. Nolan, what's your pick? One or two? - I'm gonna go two. - [MrBeast] What's your pick? - One. - Okay. Chandler, you want to tell\nthem what number you picked? - I picked two. - Yes! - [MrBeast] They picked two. - I have to go back on the boat! - Are you getting seasick by this point? - I'm so happy you're still in. - Nolan, you can head on back. - I can still sell the island. - I'm so sorry. - Today's been a\nrollercoaster of emotions. It's been ups, downs, but I'm still here. - Bye! Third time's a charm. - Nolan! What's up, dude? My biggest competition is probably Karl. But we're on the same team right now. But if he separates us,\nwhich I think he will, there's gonna be a problem. - I'm an animal. I'm an animal. We got this. We're winning. - The second to last\nchallenge is coconut bowling. We set up bowling pins\nand we have coconuts. They have to bowl. (pins fall) Ooh! And see how many they can knock over. Dude, I'm pretty good. - That was first try. We're deciding who's getting\na $700,000 island by bowling? - That sounds about right. - [Karl] Okay. - Karl pick who goes first. Nolan it is. Nolan! Here's your golden coconut. You get one bowl. Whoever knocks down the\nleast amount of pins loses. - It's just a little bit of pressure. Not much pressure. - [MrBeast] Let's see it. The island, baby. The island! Oh! - I'm not happy with that! I'm not happy with that! Bro, some stupid pins\ncould cost me 700 grand. - They probably already did. So, you can go take a seat, sir. - Yeah, all I have to do\nis give a little effort and I'm beating Nolan. - If you knock over five pins,\nyou have a guaranteed slot in the final two. Chandler! Chandler! - Oh! - Ain't nobody beating that! I think there's 10 down there, and I think there's 10 knocked down. That's 700 grand! - This is the least\nconfident I've ever been about any of the challenges\nwe've done today. I'm not gonna lie. - You literally just have\nto knock over half the pins. - I know. - Karl is known for choking. - Exactly. - Hear that music getting more dramatic? The whole world is watching. You watch \"Survivor\" every week. - I know. - Well, make it happen! - Let's do it! Ready to watch dreams come true? - No! - Don't think about how your entire life you'll think about this bowl if you miss. - Karl, just please hit at least one. - Oh my God. - Don't choke! - Karl! He did it, he did it,\nhe did it, he did it. - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - There's four! We tied! - Karl! I thought you were gone. - I barely reached the pins. - [Chandler] Yo, they fell in slow motion. - [Karl] I don't know. - Karl, the ball literally\nstopped in front of the pins. - [Karl] And just went... - [MrBeast] And then knocked over four! - Oh my gosh! - Remember how I said the\nmusic was getting intense? - Yeah. - Now it's getting more intense. - Oh God. - Nolan, I think we can cut the chatter. Literally all you have to\ndo is knock over some pins. Just hit it. Feel the moment. - Yes! - [MrBeast] Oh my gosh. - No! No! I keep on throwing it left! I missed all the pins! - Karl, step up to the plate, step up. - All you have to do is hit one. - Booyah! Woo! Yes! - Nolan, no. - We did it. - I'm proud of you, Karl. You clutched up, man! - Oh my God. - But you still didn't do better\nthan me, but you did good. - Nolan, buddy, I'm sorry. I know you wanted 700 grand. - Just wanted to sell it. - I know you did. I know. But the island deserves not to be sold. - Yeah, I'm not gonna sell it. - The boat will be here any second, but this time it's different. It's carrying all the losers on it. - Why? - You'll find out in a little bit. Welcome back, everybody! - I don't know why you're here, but hey! - Welcome back, everybody. Nolan, I need you to join them. - [Karl] Nolan wasn't rolling! Am I right? - Our final two contestants\nare Karl and Chandler. - Let's go! - You're probably wondering why I brought all eight of you back, and you're probably wondering as well. You guys will decide who\nwins this $700,000 island. And here's how we're gonna do it. Chandler, we'll let you go first. I'm gonna give you a\nminute to plead your case. Say whatever you want. - Guys, if this magic trick\ndoes not convince you, I don't know what will. As you can see, they're connected. (everyone applauds) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. - I don't know what just happened. This is a serious video, I promise. All right, Karl, come on over here. - I can't one up that speech. - Yeah, I don't know\nhow you're gonna one up whatever just happened there. But Karl, you have the floor. These eight people determine\nwhether or not you're rich. - Oh!\n- Oh! - He just turned around. Oh, Dean just turned around too. See, it doesn't matter if\nyou get in the top two, it matters how you got in the top two. - Here you go. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. - Maybe you should dance. (upbeat music) - All right, I'm ending it here. I'm ending it here. You're picking who leaves. We'll start on the end, and\nwe'll work our way over. Nolan, proceed. Who do you wanna vote off? - Sorry, Karl. You caused this. - I don't think I need to talk anymore. The betrayal. Karl gotta go. - Me and my boy, Karl, we're\ngoing to the finals together. I am voting out Chandler.\n- Wait, really? - I love both of them so much, but I know if Carl doesn't win\nthis, he's gonna be very sad. \"Survivor\" is the only thing\nhe cares about in life. I'm voting Chandler. - I'm writing down Chandler 'cause I really don't think\nKarl's gonna get a single vote. Karl had it hard. I wanna make sure he\ngets at least one vote. - I feel bad. Sorry, Karl. You're still my friend. - [MrBeast] All right, there, Jed. - Karl played a good game. But on the other hand,\nI now hate coconuts, and his head is just\nkind of shaped like one. Like, it's difficult. - All right, come on down. You're the last vote. - It's tough because\nKarl wrote my name down. It's almost like I'm supposed\nto feel sympathy for him, but he didn't feel sympathy\nfor me when I got voted off. Nothing personal. I'm so sorry. - All right, I'm now gonna read 'em off. Karl. - Oh wait, that's bad. - Karl again. Chandler. Chandler again. - [Chris] It's tied up. - Oh.\n- Anxiety. - Karl. - Less anxiety. - Chandler. Three votes for each so far. - Yo, it looks like a\ncouple names on there. - Karl. - [Chris] This is the final one. - Currently Karl has four\nvotes and Chandler has three. The final vote goes towards Chandler. It was a tie. - Oh! - Y'all just all change\nyour minds about Karl? I thought you guys hated him. - Karl was in the lead, and\nthen he was the last person. And then he flipped a coin. - [Chris] What happens now? - I didn't really have a backup plan. - Honestly, I thought it was\ngonna be completely different. - Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put all\nthese votes back in here. All eight votes are now back in the box. I'm gonna let someone pull one. Jed got out first. He didn't really get to do\nmuch, so let's let him do this. - Yay, Jed! - [MrBeast] He's about to determine whether or not you have 700 grand. - [Tyler] Oh, snap, he has it already. - The winner of Survivor MrBeast, Chandler. - Oh! (Chandler yells) Let's freaking go! Yes! - [Jessie] You got 2nd place. - Karl, it's just like hide\nand seek all over again. - Lost a million dollars all\nthe way up to this point. I won 700,000. - I thought this was my time. - I'd say he is overreacting, but $700,000 would be enough to retire. - If anything under-reacting right now. - This is going in my room. - You're gonna win one day. - Guys, Karl's officially\nlost over a million dollars in challenges. - Yeah! - Look, now you get to win. - All right, I can't, I can't. - Don't get hurt on my island! I'm responsible! You guys made memes about\nme, saying I would never win. Well, look I tried today and I won! - You heard the man! Make memes about him winning! Now hit that subscribe button so you don't lose $700,000 in the future. Congrats on your island. Karl, stop crying. We'll see you in the next video. \u266a MrBeast6000 \u266a \u266a Oh oh \u266a (explosion sounds)", "channel_id": "UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA", "channel_name": "MrBeast", "channel_subscribers": "377000000", "channel_videos": 24, "channel_views": "76059412657", "video_comments": "224692", "video_dislikes": 0, "video_likes": "5800307", "video_views": "279345667", "video_title": "Last To Leave $800,000 Island Keeps It"}

This right here is the\nroom I will be suffering in for the next two days. Normally, I do 24 hours\nin a challenge like this, but I decided I'd push\nmyself and go for 50. This is a one-way mirror\nand I can't see through it, but the boys on the other side can. Chris could be licking this\nmirror and I can't tell. - Oh, I'm licking it all right. - There's a TV in here\nthat they have control of. - Ima play his first video. - [Jimmy] Mr. Beast. Hey, that's my channel. - [Chris] That's real torture,\nwatching your old videos. - I hate you guys. (pounding on glass) I'm scared. Let's see if the door's actually locked. Oh, darn it, that would've been funny. Can I open this? Oh, I can't. If I leave early, my punishment is I have to get slimed. But if I survive all 50 hours, then all the boys have to get slimed. Which is why they're\ngonna try to get me out. - So we just found out that\nif we don't get Jimmy out before the 50 hours, we get slimed. I didn't know that. - I didn't either, but we gotta\nmake sure he gets out now. - That's gross.\n- Hey, Jimmy. Do you wanna hear what the inside of my throat sounds like? (retching sounds) - Thank you. These are my friends. - Enjoy the most annoying\nthing in the entire world, (meowing)\nMinecraft cats. - I will admit, it's pretty annoying, but I'm not cracking. Are they gonna make me listen to this? - I'm trying to annoy Jimmy so I'm having \"Are You Going to Finish\nThat Croissant?\" play. - [Video] Are you going\nto finish that croissant? - I think I'm in hell. - I don't know how it can\nget much worse, to be honest. - [Video] That croissant. - It's finally done. (man moaning) (guys laughing) - I'm just gonna lay here and ignore it. They'll get bored eventually. (person farting) (guys laughing) - Look at him on the floor. He's on the floor. (screeching sound) - [Jimmy] Hey, open up. - What?\n- Open up. - What? - [Jimmy] Let me talk to them. Wait, here, sit there. Shut up! Normally, when I torture\nyou guys, I give you money. Am I getting money? - You're getting something\nelse green, it's slime. - Enjoy all 10 hours of Patrick sleeping. (chair hitting door) - Oh my God. (metal music) - We're good, we fixed it. (whimsical music) Gonna give Jimmy the most anxiety ever. (phone buzzing) Enjoy this. Got a couple of notifications,\nbetter check them. (metal music) - I almost had 'em. After listening to this iPhone alarm on repeat for over an hour, I realized this was gonna be a lot\nharder than I thought. I'm kind of going crazy. So here's the game plan. Those are the speakers. I have a chair. I can take the tripod from this camera, and we're gonna put you on the ground. Oh, yes, all right, I got one. Ah, ah. They don't have an off switch, so I think I have to\njust bash them together. Batter up. Shut up, I'm tired! It's been an hour. Yes, die! Yes, it's gone! You know how nice it is not to hear an iPhone alarm\nin your ear constantly. I think they were gonna make\nme listen to this for 10 hours. That's ridiculous. All right, I'm gonna try\nto get some shut eye. I think they all left to go get things, which means I'm here alone. And when they get back,\nthey're not gonna let me sleep. So I'm gonna try to get some sleep now. Hopefully, I can catch a few\nZs 'cause I guarantee you tonight, they're not\ngonna let me sleep at all. Also not hearing that\niPhone alarm is amazing. I literally thought I was gonna die. - Hey, Jimmy, hello? - Sounds like the speaker's off. - He broke the speakers.\n- He broke the speakers. - I'm gonna sneak in there and fix it. You messed up the speaker. - Chris, hey, you can't come in here. You guys can't do this. - Oh, my gosh.\n- Help! - Oh, wait. - Give me the pillow. - Give him the pillow! - I got it, I got it. - Get out. Go, close. - This is a load of barnacles. - How are we gonna get to this man? - Despite only being three\nhours in the challenge, it was honestly getting pretty rough. But thankfully, I\ndestroyed their speakers. - We can't play a speaker in there, but we can play a speaker\nout here into there. He destroyed the entire sound system. - So this is our solution. - I have a three part plan to hide myself. Step one is I need to block the door so they can't see me through that. Step two is I need to cover the mirror. Step three is I need to cover the cameras. Once I do all that, they'll have no way of seeing what I'm up to. - Why's he taking a part of the bed? What's he doing? (laughing) - [Video] Clouds? - Clouds! - [Video] Clouds?\n- Clouds? - [Video] Clouds? - I'm taking off the walls\nand covering the mirror. I'm gonna turn it towards\nfacing the corner. Now that camera can't see\nthis side of the room. As you can see, it can't currently see me. And boom, now, the window is\nsealed, they can't see me. And I moved the other camera. They have no eyes on me currently. So hopefully, I can get a good nap in and they can't wake me up. - We just filmed a rap. All of it was freestyle. Jimmy, you're not gonna be able to sleep because you're gonna hear our sweet voices rapping all night long. - I've been in here\nfor almost eight hours. I'm bored and I still have 42 hours left. I'm not even a fifth of the way done. I think I hear Karl above me, but I don't know what he's doing. - So I'm on top of the isolation room. I have the speakers all set up. We're gonna open it up right there, and we're gonna play some music. He's not gonna be able to\nreach it, so we get to win. - Is Karl above me? - Maybe. - So if I were to do\nthis, I won't hit anyone. - Oh, my God. - I knew it, he is up there! - Come here. - No, you come here. - No, I can't.\n- I can't. - Yes you can. - I'm listening to a screaming goat. - Nerd! - Is this what you've been\ndoing the last five hours? - Yes! (goat screaming) - I don't like seeing it\nfrom this side, Jimmy. - I'm gonna hide under this blanket, and they're gonna\neventually stop torturing me because I'm not gonna react\nand they're gonna get bored. - What we're about to do is play the rap we recorded for Jimmy, 'cause I think it's gonna annoy him pretty good. - Jimmy! I'm gonna lower the speakers. We worked really hard on this, so please don't hurt the speakers, okay? We'll play it over and over. - \u266a Jimmy ain't finna sleep (no sir) \u266a - I'm not gonna get them the\nsatisfaction of reacting. (muffled rap music) - Hey, from the top, one more! (rap music) - All right, so we got Jimmy's food. Sorry, here's your food. - Thank you. Solitary confinement,\nmore like solitary easy. Thank you nerds. I don't know why they\ngave me a filet mignon, but I'm not complaining, it tastes good. They're making this a little too easy. I need a ladder to fix that\ncamera, it's really high up. You guys took my tripod. - Okay, that's fair. You'll give this back, right?\n- Yeah. My plan worked, I now have a ladder. Karl made this hole in the wall, and I might be able to\nreach it with this ladder. (suspenseful music) Ha ha, I got the speakers, okay. Gonna throw those over there. Out of sight, out of mind. I'm good at this stuff. And now I'll fix their camera. Now that I got what I wanted. Welcome back camera,\nsorry for abusing you. Don't know what that was. - Hey, Jimmy, please don't tell them I gave you the ladder, please. - Nothing happened.\n- All right, cool. - Just don't tell 'em why\ntheir speakers are gone. - Sounds good. - Who took the speakers? - Karl, someone, whoever\nstole those speakers, shout out to you, I love you. - You really didn't take 'em? I'm so confused. (low tempo music) - We got Jimmy a little gift. This is his favorite actor\nthat's ever existed, Drake Bell. - Hey, what's up Jimmy? It's Drake bell here. Mr. Beast, I hope that you, you succeed in your challenge. But Karl wants me to say that you should really leave your room. You should really leave the room. I hope you succeed. I hope that you are able to- - Turn it off, it backfired! Jake, turn it off. - Drake wants me to succeed. For Drake, for Drake! I'm doing this for Drake Bell! - I don't know why I didn't\nwatch it before showing him, but it backfired completely. And now I think it's gonna\ngive him a burst of energy. So we gotta diminish\nthat as much as possible. - Why'd you have to go\nback on what we said? Just read the script! - I have an alarm clock. - I have 47 alarm clocks. - And we took off the top so\nthat he can't turn it off. - Oh, Jimmy's gotta wake up. Hey man, it's time to wake\nup, your alarm's going off. (alarms beeping) - Why do you guys have so many alarms? - 'Cause it's alarming\nyou're not awake yet, Jimmy - Your alarms turned off,\nI didn't even do anything. - Karl what did you do wrong? - I wasn't even asleep,\nI was just laying here. - Do you need a hand? - Now he has a siren. Who gave him a siren? - Yeet, oh, my God! - I think at this point\nwe're just exciting him with how much that we're\nhanging out with him. I think we just absolutely\nisolate him now. - Yes. - It's been a pretty crazy first half day. The boys don't seem to be\nmessing with me at the moment. So I'm gonna try to get some Zs. I'll see you in the morning. (whimsical music) Good morning, Tarik. Yeah, you turning on cameras? - Yeah. - What is this, solitary cam-finement? - Yes it is. - They made a mistake\ngiving me this bad boy. - Guys he's gonna cause destruction! Oh, my God, he broke the TV. No, no, no, no! TV, dude. - Broke our TV. Karl, I'll hand this to you, go. - [Man] Battery, battery, battery! - Jimmy, you want some entertainment? - [Jimmy] I do! - All right here it comes. How's that for entertainment? - [Jimmy] I hope you fall! - So I just wanted to get Jimmy a cake, 'cause he's been in here for a while, and he could probably\nuse a cake right now. - When I do \"last to leaves,\" I typically feed the\nboys so they don't die. - That's true, that's very true. I'll get you something good. - Maybe if I had something that properly nutritionized my body. - Okay.\n- That's not a word. I might not slime you. 'Cause we all know I'm\ngonna win, I don't care. Play all the Luigi screaming you want. - In there, oh! - That actually splashed\non me a little bit. - [Jimmy] I missed. - Jimmy wanted a nutritious meal. If he doesn't like that,\nI have a backup plan. - I was not expecting that, thank you! - What are you chowing on? - Some lasagna and chicken. - What? - No, no, this is pretty easy, thank you. - This man's gotten lasagna, steak, cake. What has he not eaten in this challenge? Last challenge, I had beans. - What did I do to deserve this? - That's sad. I feel terrible. Why would you voluntarily\ndo this to yourself? - Hey Jimmy, you have a visitor. - Oh, hey. - This is scary, I don't like this at all. I'm not loving that orange on you. - I think that's the least of my concerns. I've been in here for 35 hours. - Don't you want to get out\nand go home with Maddie, Jimmy? - No, not really, it's 15 more hours. - It's solitary confinement. Not solitary hang out\nwith your girlfriend. (rock music) - I smell so bad. - Hey Karl, you ready? - Yes. - I'm coming in! Geronimo! - I actually thought that was Karl. It's been a while since I heard from them, so I think they actually\nwent home for the night. Which means I've got it easy. Or they're waiting for me to go to sleep so they can wake me up and piss me off. - [Woman] They ask you how you are. You just have to say that you're fine, when you're not really fine. - I've been laying on this mattress for the last few hours, just chilling. Could've sworn the guys were gonna come back to mess with\nme, but they didn't. So, I guess I'll just\ngo to bed, I don't know. I'm excited to get outta\nhere, this is my last night. This place is disgusting. Gosh, I miss my bed, this sucks. (guitar music) - It's time to wake Jimmy up, so let's give him something to listen to. - Good morning, like a normal person, I start off the morning with a pee. They got rid of my timer, so I don't know how\nlong I've been in here. Also, I forgot to flush the toilet. To be honest, this isn't as\nhard as I thought it would be. I thought while doing this\nchallenge, I'd go really crazy, but I'm actually only\ngoing slightly crazy. - Jimmy, no cheating. - Four hours and 30 minutes left? - Dummy. - Bro, he thinks there's four hours left and he still feels good. There's only 43 minutes left, we gotta mess with him. (leaf blower blowing) - Had to get all your stink out. - Oh, it's pretty bad. (intense music) - All right, Jimmy, the clock's at zero. You can come out now. - Okay. - All right, let's let him out. You can come out. - Oh, what if I did. Based on that reaction that means- - No, we were just wondering\nif you were gonna fall. - Yeah, yeah. They arrived at 9:00 AM. They then proceeded to make me watch an hour and a half of memes, and they messed with me for 20 minutes. On God, it's 10:50 not 11:15, when I get out. I have an hour and 20 minutes left. I'm not leaving early, close this door. You guys are jerks. - We already know we lost.\n- Yeah. - So I wanted to get him\nin there for another hour. - Let's go watch an anime. - Let's go watch an anime, come on. - Hey, what's up? - You can unlock the\ndoor, it's been an hour. - You stayed in an hour extra, by the way. You stayed 51 hours in solitary. - Your mom stayed 51 hours in solitary. - She did not.\n- You're not my mom. - Oh, he's out, bro. - [Woman] Transition. - I survived 50 hours of your torture. I had to listen to an iPhone\nalarm for three hours. - It was an accident. - Go ahead, dump the slime. - Don't do it. - Jimmy, let's talk about,\nlet's talk about it. - Stop, stop, stop. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (all yelling) - Huggies, huggies! - No, Chris, no! - \u266a Mr. Beast 6000, oh whoa \u266a (explosion)", "channel_id": "UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA", "channel_name": "MrBeast", "channel_subscribers": "377000000", "channel_videos": 24, "channel_views": "76059412657", "video_comments": "116814", "video_dislikes": 0, "video_likes": "5060510", "video_views": "329036861", "video_title": "I Spent 50 Hours In Solitary Confinement"}
